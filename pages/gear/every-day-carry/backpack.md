[Backpack: 33L Marathon Magic](http://www.aarnpacks.com/marathon-magics)
[Balance Pockets: Mountain](http://www.aarnpacks.com/ultralite-balance-pockets)
[Chest Straps: X-flow Straps](http://www.aarnpacks.com/accessories)
[Dry Bag: Daypack Dry Liner](http://www.aarnpacks.com/accessories)

### Biomechanics

- Want to keep center of mass consistent, no uneven torques or imbalances.
- Pack should not inhibit free movement.
- Chest straps should not inhibit breathing.
- Weight bearing should primarily be on hips not shoulders.

### Utility

- Want some way to keep objects dry.
  - Todo: Exlain why internal removable dry liner is superior to other options. Abrasion resistance, ability to stow rain-gear, waterproof in submersion, etc.
- Buckle closure is faster, more water resistant, and more durable than zipper closure.
- Want enough volume to be useful, but not so much that you are always carrying around extra material that you are not making use of. ~35L is a pretty decent compromise for most purposes.
- Pack should have decent aerodynamics.
