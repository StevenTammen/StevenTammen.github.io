- [Binder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B75TRG/)
- TODO: identify most durable, well designed 2-pocket dividers.

### Basic Variables

- Durability: aluminum provides much better durability than cheap plastic-covered cardboard.
- Functionality: metal binder doubles as a clipboard so a separate one does not need to be carried around, provided the surfaces are kept clean.
- Size: for transportability and everyday uses, 1" is the best size (vs 2" or 0.5" inch etc.)
- Closing mechanism: TODO -- compare circular vs D-ring enclosure for <= 1" binders.
- Can carry around most current class notes in page protectors, and daily transfer new ones out. Pockets on each divider for each class. Replaces folders and spirals all in one.
