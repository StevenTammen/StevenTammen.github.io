- [Grayl Filtration Bottle](http://www.thegrayl.com/buy/grayl-legend-travel-purifier)
   - Should probably wait until Flouride filtration gets implemented. For backcountry use floride isn't a factor, but for municipal use, where some places still insist on flourinating water, lack of flouride filitration is problematic.

## Materials Concerns

### Plastics: Bisphenols, Pthalates, and Endocrine Disruption

- Plastics companies have a powerful corporate lobby much in the same way that tobacco companies did before legislators finally did their job and stopped letting them intentionally promote harmful products. In fact, some lobbyists from tobacco corporations moved right on over to plastics corporations when their former line of employment got shut down.
   - It is my personal opinion that folks who intentionally promote bad science and misleading claims that lead to loss of life (e.g., "smoking doesn't cause lung cancer", "BPA doesnt *really* affect human endocrinology that much") should be charged with some form of manslaughter if they knowingly and willingly fabricate data and lie about evidence. This would include FDA officials that take corporate bribes and/or intentionally look the other way concerning contradictory/disconfirmatory studies.
   - I also think it would be a step in the right direction if regulatory bureaucrats and corporate employees were separate groups under federal law (i.e., working for the FDA at any time would mean you could not serve as a consultant later for some big pharma company, and working for some big pharma company would mean that you could not work at the FDA later). It wouldn't hurt if FDA employees also had to pass yearly competency tests (in biochemistry/chemistry, ethics, and experimental/statistical methodology) as well as yearly conflict of interest screenings.
   - Finally, I think FDA regulation should shift from "safe until too many people get sick/die, at which point the drug/chemical probably still won't be pulled because of corporate obfuscation" to "unsafe until there is a reasonable amount of evidence about the effects of short and long term exposure". Corporations would lose money because proper testing is expensive and time-consuming, but at least truth would prevail and people would stop getting hurt.
- Polycarbonate and other hard-resin plastics used to use bisphenol A (BPA) as an additive to improve material properties... until the mainstream media *finally* caught wind of the fact that BPA is an endocrine disruptor (which some of these companies presumably knew already). After a few hard-fought years of progress, BPA has mostly been removed from consumer plastic products. A timeline of significant events in the struggle can be seen [here](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/03/regulatory-capture-bpa-plastic-estrogen-endocrine-disruptor-feds).
- Plastics companies have been quick to latch onto the "BPA free" label as some sort of stamp of safety even though it implies nothing of the short (analogy: if you have lead and arsenic in your water, filtering the lead out of your water does not make it *ipso facto* safe to drink because it still has arsenic in it; the absence of one toxic chemical does not imply the absence of others). Bisphenol S (BPS) was substituted for BPA in many cases, but research is piling up that it too acts as an endocrine disruptor, perhaps to an *even greater* degree than BPA does. One study claims that almost all production plastics leach chemicals that lead to estrogenic activity (EA) in humans, particularly when subjected to stresses like heating in high humidity environments (dishwashers?), and UV light (being outside?). Mother Jones has [another page](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/03/tritan-certichem-eastman-bpa-free-plastic-safe) about these more recent developments concerning EA chemicals and BPA replacements (Eastman Tritan in particular).
- PVC formulations often contain pthalates. Pthalates are bad for similar reasons as BPA.

- If you don't know what additives are in a plastic (and you never will because companies refuse to publish their formulations), best avoid it.
- Buying higher quality products generally means you have less toxic stuff leaching into your water. It doesn't mean you'll have *no* toxic stuff leaching into your water.
- Plastics are not biodegradable and pose a huge environmental problem. (Google "Great Pacific Garbage Patch" -- try to avoid both the doomsday people and the oil company propaganda).

### Stainless steel

- Can sometimes impart metallic taste.
- Cannot be microwaved.
- Probably most durable option.
- Available in both insulated and non-insulated varieties.

### Borosilicate Glass

- As long as it's not too thick, it's pretty light. As long as it's not too thin, it's pretty durable. (Especially if you use protective sleeves made out of silicone or something else similar).
- Imparts no taste.

## Mouth Width

- Wider is easier to load with ice cubes, smoothies, etc. (although funnels really make this not terribly important), easier to clean, and also more resistant to freezing solid if bottles are filled completely (which they usually won't be). However, wider is harder to drink from while walking, driving, or laying down.
- Narrower is easier to drink out of when walking, driving, or laying down.
- If you have an intelligently design lid you can get the advantages of both wide and narrow.
