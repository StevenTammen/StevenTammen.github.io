## Options

LM = [Leatherman Charge TTI](https://www.amazon.com/Leatherman-Charge-Multi-Tool-Stainless-Leather/dp/B019EN7RWC)
Vic = [Victorinox SwissTool Spirit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T5YNW/)

## LM Pros

- one-hand opening blades
- S30v steel
- true needle nose pliers that open wide
- diamond file
- wider opening scissors
- more sharply machined screwdrivers much less likely to slip
- better wire cutters
- a pocket clip that is one of the best available on any pocket knife.

## LM Cons

- Have to open to get to smaller tools
- Stubby bit drivers, no shank to get into places

## Vic Pros

- All tools accessible from outside
- All tools lock
- Pliers meet at tip, so parallel when you grip rather than when closed which doesn’t make any sense
- Handle design very good for pliers ergonomically, doesn’t really inhibit use of other tools
- Rounded edges comfortable to hold

## Vic improvements

- Don’t rivet together, screws
- Slightly narrower pliers
- Let pliers open little wider
- Cutting hook
- Diamond coated file + more medium coarse on wood/metal side
- Improve grip of surface (not necessarily bead blasted — corrosion factors — but more grippable texture)
- Switch scissors around to be able to cut nails
- Make scissors openable to be able to sharpen
- One hand opening serrated knife, some way to get it open even when cold
- One hand opening for other tools like saw+file too?
- Spring loaded pliers
- Removable wire cutter inserts (resharpen)
- Ruler on side
- Squared off (rather than rounded off) screwdrivers, harder steel (won’t strip as easily)
- Doesn’t matter: pocket clip
- Torx screw it together, make it replaceable
