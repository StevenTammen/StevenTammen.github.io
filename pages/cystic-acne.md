## Structure Of This Page

Compared to a lot of the writing on this site, this page is going to be more stream-of-consciousness and less organized. This is because the science concerning cystic acne is contradictory and not particularly illuminating, in my opinion. In other words, since they haven't really figured it out yet (at least well enough to treat it in my case), the subjective angle is really the only angle at the moment.

## About Me

First, some background. I have fought moderate to severe cystic acne since I was 15. That was 6 years ago. Over this period I have seen a dermatologist and been prescribed antibiotics (doxycycline; sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, aka Bactrim) and isotretinoin (commonly called Accutane). I am currently towards the end of my course of isotretinoin.

## No, Ignorant Person, I Am Not a Slob

Let's dispense with some of the popular wisdom first -- for some people, acne is not just a lifestyle thing. For example:

- I know more about nutrition and eat better than the vast majority of the American public (although that's not exactly saying much), especially since I've started cooking for myself. I haven't eaten processed sugar as regular part of my diet for years (though sometimes I will indulge, depending on the occasion). I eat lots of vegetables. I eat fish (salmon and sardines) to balance my omega-3 and omega-6 ratio and reduce systemic inflammation. I could go on. The point is, rather than my diet being worse than most people's (thereby causing skin problems), it is orders of magnitude better.
- I do not consume alcohol, smoke, or do other drugs.
- I have a had a consistent skin care regimen for years. I regularly take showers, exfoliate, and moisturize my skin. I don't ever let personal hygiene take a backseat to circumstances or being tired.
- I manage stress better than most college students do. I have read multiple books on stress management, human cognition, and the effects of cortisol and epinephrine on the body. I have maintained high grades across multiple academic fields and never had the sort of mental health problems related to anxiety that many college students struggle with.
- I prioritize sleep and avoid the sort of cramming that forces inconsistent sleeping schedules (e.g., I have never pulled an all-nighter in college). I regularly get 9 hours of sleep a night.
- While I haven't exercised as consistently as I would have liked, I am far from being overweight (I'm just under 6'5'' and around 185 lbs). 
- etc.

I have come across many people over the years who seem to think that persistent, cystic acne is some sort of easily treatable condition that I've just failed to research enough. "Why don't you just use Exposed Skincare or Proactiv? Don't you know they make products for this stuff?"

The problem when talking to these folks is that, to them, all acne is the same. They view the occasional blemish they get from teenage hormones as qualitatively identical to inflamed, deep-rooted cysts. Even some people who are otherwise perfectly intelligent conflate the two because they think the etiologies are the same (hair follicles getting blocked and subsequently infected by *P. acnes* which feeds off of a compound in skin oil called sebum). While they're not strictly incorrect, it's a lot more complicated than that, and exactly why some people struggle with acne while others don't is still not well understood.

All this to say, in many cases, blaming cystic acne on the person suffering from it has about as much basis in science as blaming clinical depression on the person suffering from it. I wish it were as simple as me being a slob. Because I can fix slobbishness. It's much harder to fix a chronic disease with complicated, multifactorial origins and no guaranteed cure.

## Self Esteem Issues

I am thankful to be a person that does not derive most of my self-worth from my physical appearance. Vain people with cystic acne must have a really rough go at it.

This being said, I do not enjoy the self-consciousness that cystic acne invariably brings. Sometimes friends and acquaintances will comment, not realizing that we are in fact quite aware of our condition. Cystic acne is painful -- it's not like blemishes can simply escape our notice in the mirror, because any pressure on them will send arcs of pain coursing through our nerves.

Even for the most rational of us, who strive to separate a condition ultimately out of our control from self-esteem, the connection exists. Humans are irredeemably irrational in some areas, and this is unfortunately one of them. It doesn't matter much that it doesn't make any logical sense -- sometimes it's easy to feel like a lesser human being simply from being plagued by a chronic illness visible to others.

## My Tips For Fellow Sufferers

### Ignore Internet Scaremongering

I put off isotretinoin (Accutane) for a long time because there was a large contingency of people on the internet basically equating it to poison. My experience hasn't been all sunshine and unicorns (it has caused some fairly significant flare-ups for me on my chest where I'd never had much of a problem before), but it has significantly improved the acne on my face and back (as in basically eliminated it). As long as you use an OTC lip balm (chapstick isn't going to cut it), the dry lips thing isn't a huge deal. I've experienced no other side effects that I am aware of. 

The reason why there is so much doom and gloom on the internet is because of two things: something statisticians call response bias, and something philosophers call the *post hoc ergo propter hoc* logical fallacy. The response bias is basically this: people who had really terrible experiences are much more likely to post comments on acne boards and the like than people who had good experiences. So the comments on the internet are far more negative overall than the actual success rate of the drug. The logical fallacy, literally translated as "after this, therefore, on account of this" deals with the concept of false causality. If anything bad happens to someone when they start taking isotretinoin, they may blame it on the drug rather than its real cause. This leads to a large number of claimed horrific side effects that are probably not at all related to isotretinoin (since they have failed to be replicated in large, controlled studies).

I really wish I had gone on isotretinoin early on instead of after 5 years of cystic acne. I have scarring that I will carry with me for the rest of my life that might have been preventable if I had listened to my dermatologist more than random individuals on the internet.

(Note: with all this having been said, isotretinoin is still a potent drug, and I'm sure some people really do have serious and sometimes permanent side effects from it. You should consider whether you think the risks are acceptable).

### Avoid The Naturalistic Fallacy

In other words, don't shun salicylic acid for tea tree oil just because alternative medicine gurus like Joe Mercola say modern medicine is evil. As I have said elsewhere on the site, trust methodologically-sound, peer-reviewed, double-blind scientific studies conducted by qualified and respected researchers without conflicts of interest and funded by entities without an axe to grind. Donâ€™t trust anything or anyone else.

You may also want to avoid Paleo mommy bloggers and the like. It's not that these folks are always wrong, but they typically aren't very scientific. At best, you'll be wasting time and money. At worst, you'll buy into a way of thinking that will make it harder for you to accept true science further down the line.

### Treat The Cause Not The Symptoms

This is a gripe that the alternative medicine people are actually right about. Modern medicine does sometimes forgo treating an underlying condition in lieu of its symptoms, and acne is a good example. Antibiotics will probably help your acne temporarily -- and if your acne is of the teenage, hormonal variety, that may be all you need. But for those of us who actually have a chronic problem with cystic acne, antibiotics are not addressing the root cause (whatever that may be). Longer term use of antibiotics is also something I'm leery of, both on a personal level (there's not much science on how safe it is long-term; our bodies depend on a whole host of good bacteria that get wiped out too), and on a societal level (we don't want to speed up the development of antibiotic resistant superbug strains like MRSA).

The trick is, of course, finding out what the root cause is *for you*. Unfortunately, I don't think I have it all figured out in my case. My acne definitely flares when I am under heavy stress (like finals week) and when my immune system gets compromised (like when I'm sick). Other than these things, I haven't been able to put my finger on any one thing that is causing the underlying condition.

I am just starting an elimination diet where I forgo dairy and grains (most especially wheat), since some people have reported n=1 success by eliminating either category of foods. I was sort of hoping the isotretinoin would work so I wouldn't have to be so uptight about my diet for the rest of my life, but it's looking like I may be in it for the long haul. If eliminating one of these foods does work for me (on more than a placebo level), I'll report back.

### Don't Get Depressed About It

Try to look on the bright side. It could be a lot worse. You could have been born blind and deaf, or without legs, or with another completely debilitating condition that makes cystic acne look downright mild.

Also try to think about the introspection that cystic acne has given you. You probably draw your self worth from things other than physical appearance (like discipline, integrity, and kindness). Even the most beautiful people will eventually get old and be forced to make a transition in values (if they were vain, that is). You've just grown up faster and made the transition earlier.

You are also probably much less likely than the general population to judge others based on appearance since you know what it feels like. Given that judging others based on appearance alone is shallow and unfair, the fact that you have this empathy can make it much easier to relate to others.

### At The Same Time, Don't Pretend It's Not a Problem

I used to strongly dislike making other people uncomfortable. When I was a kid I would much rather downplay how hurtful something really was to me than call someone out on it. This meant that I was bullied somewhat in elementary school and early middle school.

Thankfully, I grew out of the timid phase. (It helped that I was competitive and regularly scorched the mean folks on anything and everything related to academics). Nowadays I'm typically one of the first people to speak up if I think something is wrong or if someone is being unfair. I also try to be brutally honest and matter-of-fact about problems, since pretending that they are not there never gets them solved.

What all of this has to do with acne is this -- I never try to downplay the severity of it or the negative effects it has on me. I don't try to be all macho and strong just for the sake of not burdening others. I also don't pretend everything is OK if it's not. Having cystic acne really stinks -- full stop. Trying to act all upbeat and say it's not so bad will do you more harm in the long run than good, because it's not true.

Of course, you don't want to go around making a bigger deal of things than necessary. I personally despise people fishing for pity. I don't want pity. I want to be treated like a normal human being, one who just happens to have a chronic illness outside of my control.

## Final thoughts

I think that acne is something that science has sort of downplayed as a temporary condition of adolescence that everyone goes through. The problem is, not all acne is the same. The serious, chronic sort is a full-blown illness. It's not inherently life-threatening like cancer or heart disease, but it has very serious negative consequences in some cases: social anxiety, depression, and even suicide.

It is also misunderstood and mischaracterized by the media and the general public. For most of us, it is not primarily caused by poor hygiene, stress, or a bad diet -- there are other, more complicated, variables at play. Repeating such falsehoods is damaging to the self-esteem of sufferers, but is also just objectively wrong.
