## Sites That I Think Are Good

### [alexvermeer.com](https://alexvermeer.com/)

This is one of my favorite sites. Lots of useful information on a variety of topics, wth an emphasis on productivity.

Good pages to look at:

- [Life Hacking](https://alexvermeer.com/life-hacking/) (not the lame bandwagon variety, but the real variety)
- [Planning](https://alexvermeer.com/8760hours/)
- [Limiting Procrastination](https://alexvermeer.com/limit-procrastination/)

### [drbunsen.org](http://www.drbunsen.org/)

Another one of my favorites. This one is a bit more technical and geeky, but has a lot of cool content.

Good pages to look at:

- [Poisson Eats Cheeseburgers](http://www.drbunsen.org/poisson-eats-cheeseburgers/)
- [Estimation Techniques](http://www.drbunsen.org/snakes-on-a-plane/)
- [The Text Triumverate](http://www.drbunsen.org/the-text-triumvirate/)

### [thesimplebrief.com](http://www.thesimplebrief.com/)

Minimalism, organization, lifestyle, and stenography. One of the more true blogs on this list. I like this site a lot.

Good pages to look at:

- [Rational Organization](http://www.thesimplebrief.com/introduction-to-organization/)
- [Rethinking Necessity](http://www.thesimplebrief.com/rethink2/)
- [Adapting Steno Dictionaries](http://www.thesimplebrief.com/how-to-make-marks-dictionary-work-for-you/)

### [lesswrong.com](http://lesswrong.com/)

Learn how to be rational and recognize biases. Not without biases of its own, of course. Not for the faint of heart.

Good pages to look at:

- [Rationality: A-Z](https://www.lesserwrong.com/rationality)

### [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/)

An excellent resource for learning philosophy. The quality is a bit uneven, as some authors are much better than others. Still worth spending time on, however.

Good pages to look at:

- [Kant's Moral Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/)
- [Epistemology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/)
- [Plato's Ethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics/)
- [Pragmatism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/)
