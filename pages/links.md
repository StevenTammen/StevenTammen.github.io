## Sites That I Think Are Good

- [Limiting Procrastination](https://alexvermeer.com/limit-procrastination/)

Good pages to look at:

- [Rationality: A-Z](https://www.lesserwrong.com/rationality)

### [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/)

An excellent resource for learning philosophy. The quality is a bit uneven, as some authors are much better than others. Still worth spending time on, however.
