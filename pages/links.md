## Sites That I Think Are Good

### [alexvermeer.com](https://alexvermeer.com/)

This is one of my favorite sites. Lots of useful information on life organization, beating procrastination, using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), and life-hacking in general. Highly recommended.

### [drbunsen.org](http://www.drbunsen.org/)

Another one of my favorites. Has varied content -- the author's interests overlap with mine not only in things like algorithms, optimization, and Vim, but also in things like EDC. Is one of the best examples I know of a personal site that showcases the author's intellectual range and individual take on how to life.

### [thesimplebrief.com](http://www.thesimplebrief.com/)

Minimalism, organization, lifestyle, and stenography. One of the more true blogs on this list. I like this site a lot.

### [lesswrong.com](http://lesswrong.com/)

Learn how to be rational and recognize biases. Not without biases of its own, of course. Not for the faint of heart.

### [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/)

An excellent resource for learning philosophy. Sometimes I like to just read random articles to remind myself that I'm pretty stupid compared to some humans.

### [philosophyofbrains.com](http://philosophyofbrains.com/)

Philosophy of mind meets neuroscience and pedantry. What more could you want?

### [eatingacademy.com](http://eatingacademy.com/)

Ketosis, lipidology, scientific methodology, flaws in nutritional standards, perils of observational epidemiology, and more. Interested to see where the author's new endeavors take him.
