## Pre-optimization Considerations

Before you spend time optimizing the character layout of your keyboard, you need to first make sure that you have an ergonomic keyboard, and that your work environment is setup properly. Failing to account for these things (which are really more important), no matter how good your character layout ends up being, will put you at a much higher risk for RSI and CTS.

Optimizing the character layout of your keyboard without first dealing with your workstation ergonomics is like fixing a small leak in a ship while ignoring the gaping hole in the hull — any benefit you gain here will be vastly overshadowed by the gains from improving these other areas. Again, let me repeat myself, focusing on the character layout before settling these other matters is *not* wise, and I suggest you take some time to fix any deficiencies in your current equipment/habits before continuing.

## Reasons Why You Should Not Optimize

### Priorities

An axiom of existence is the limited nature of time. With normal life responsibilities, there are only so many things that we can focus on and optimize. The more we build discipline and focus, the more we can perfect for our particular set of circumstances. But we will never be able to get to everything. It is necessary that we decide on a method for determining what we focus on, and structure our lives from most important to least important.

Keyboard layout optimization must be taken as an investment of lower marginal benefit than many things before it. It is a worthy investment, but it is not the worthiest of your consideration unless several more important things have been taken care of beforehand.

I would encourage you to go through this list and make sure you have these things in good order before you even consider sinking in time on the keyboard optimization front.

1. A personal philosophy of spiritual and existential reality.
2. Purposefully cultivated and frequently exercised habits of self-control, mindfulness, and thought.
3. An implemented and disciplined routine of intellectual expansion through reading.
4. An implemented and disciplined exercise routine that includes both cardio and resistance training.
5. An implemented and disciplined common-sense diet (free or low in processed foods, added sugar, and processed/high omega-6 oils, and high in vegetables, naturally occurring antioxidants, and omega-3's).

By “implemented” I mean you have thought it through and are capable of giving a reasoned defense of why you are doing what you are doing. By “disciplined” I mean you generally stick to what you say you are going to do.

### The Difficulty of Retraining Your Fingers

To put it simply, if you are already at 100 WPM typing QWERTY, and aren’t facing or likely to face RSI, you need to consider if this exercise is worth your while. Optimized layouts (even the bad ones, so to speak), are very much more efficient than QWERTY, and they drastically reduce the amount of effort it takes to type. But there will be an adjustment period of weeks not days, and recovering your old speed will take time. This goes doubly for those of you already using a better layout like Dvorak, Colemak, or Workman. I promise you that you can do better than any one of those three, but the gains will not be earth-shattering.

If the switch were easy or effortless, QWERTY would have ceased to exist long ago. As it is, however, you will be reduced to single digit WPMs for the first little bit, and your fingers will disobey you — you will have to rewire the neural connections in your brain that correspond to what we call “muscle memory”. If you have any sort of time-sensitive full-time occupation that forces you maintain your QWERTY skills (i.e., you can’t afford to go cold turkey and immerse yourself), it’s even harder because you’ll experience [proactive interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_theory#Proactive_interference) from already having QWERTY in muscle memory. That is to say, instead of “unlearning” QWERTY when you learn your other layout (replacing the old muscle memory with new muscle memory), the old muscle memory that you need to keep around will inhibit effective acquisition of the new muscle memory.

Depending on your dedication and consistency in practice, getting back to your previous speed can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. Poor discipline and lack of self-control can even push this from “difficult” to “impossible” — just like many people have tried to quit smoking and failed, many have tried switching away from QWERTY and failed. I would suggest that you not waste your time if you are not willing or able to put in the work necessary to be successful.

### QWERTY’s Ubiquitousness

As mentioned above, holding QWERTY in muscle memory when learning a new layout results in proactive interference. For most people, the flipside, called [retroactive interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_theory#Retroactive_interference), also holds true. Learning another layout will typically result in a loss of QWERTY speed because more errors are made — when you are trying to type a letter, your finger “forgets” that you are typing QWERTY, and instead presses the key for the letter on your other layout. While this is a problem for everyone, some people, through practice, have been able to keep high speeds on two different layouts simultaneously (e.g., Dvorak and QWERTY). Learning two layouts that are more similar to each other (like QWERTY and Colemak) is more likely to result in retroactive interference (just how learning Italian if you speak Spanish is more likely to mess with your Spanish than if you learn German), while using different physical keyboards for different character layouts (e.g., using Dvorak on a Kinesis Advantage and QWERTY on normal row-staggered keyboards) can help prevent retroactive interference.

The upshot of all this is that most people don’t continue to type with two different layouts in the long run — in other words, learning an optimized layout generally means you lose your QWERTY proficiency. The “problem” with this, of course, is that the rest of the world is designed for QWERTY and expects you to use it.

Not being able to touch-type QWERTY means your productivity will take a hit whenever you have to type on it for some reason (e.g., working on someone else’s computer or taking the GRE). You will also have to contend with poorly designed keyboard shortcuts (i.e., those with QWERTY in mind), which usually only prove to be problematic in those programs that don’t let you change them (boo on them). These are unavoidable consequences that you will face because QWERTY has become the expected layout in our society -- if you find them unacceptable, stick with QWERTY.

### The Animosity of Others

For some inexplicable reason, some people get rabid, foaming-at-the-mouth crazy in their defense of QWERTY. My best guess is that this is because your superior efficiency is a direct challenge to their self-perception as competent, effective workers. It's also possible that their defensiveness is a manifestation of the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy): having spent a significant amount of time learning to touch-type QWERTY, they don't want to admit that they picked a bad layout. There is also likely a degree of [choice-supportive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias): similar to how people evangelize the make and model of the new car they bought to help convince themselves it was worth it, people are more likely to evangelize QWERTY after deciding to make it their keyboard layout.

Whatever their motivations, people will frequently challenge your decision to use a layout other than QWERTY. If you are not the type of person that's cool taking heat for being different or constantly having to explain yourself, you may want to think twice about using a layout other than QWERTY.

(Note: you will encounter a larger group of people that is not actively antogonistic but merely confused as to why you find using another layout necessary or prudent. By and large, people in this group are happy shrugging and letting you do your thing if that's what you want -- but they may still give you weird looks. YMMV)

### Most Speed Considerations Are Layout Agnostic

There is a very real possibility if you switch that the time lost in getting back up to speed would have been better spent honing your mastery of whatever layout you do currently use, because most of the ways you can accelerate your typing don’t depend on your layout.

#### Practice

There is no magic here. Optimizing your layout won’t immediately make you a faster typist, though it certainly has the potential to eventually. The thing that will make you a faster typist is practicing a layout until you breathe it and you dream about it. This is like every single other skill in existence; the more you practice, the better you get. 

I want to here emphasize that not all practice is equal. Practice does not make perfect. Practice makes permanent (or, alternatively, “perfect practice makes perfect”). Because we tend to type a great deal in our day to day lives, there is a danger of just going on autopilot and plateauing. Whether or not you decide to continue on in this process, I can recommend that you pick up typing not as something one merely does, but as something one studies and perfects over time.

Practice the most common digraphs and trigraphs in English (or your native language if not English). Lists can be found [here](http://scottbryce.com/cryptograms/stats.htm), [here](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~mgomathi/teaching/2009/csce5550/Lectures/Cipher-Example%202.pdf), and elsewhere through a simple Google search. If you consciously train yourself to type *sequences* rather than *letters*, your speed will increase at a much faster rate.

To extend this concept even further, you should drill with [this repo](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english), which has the 10,000 most common words in English. It does you little good to type uncommon or unusual words at a high speed because they compose a small portion of what you type (e.g., typing “zyzzyva” fast does you no good because genuses of weevils don’t come up in normal conversation). Getting very fast at words like “the”, “and”, “that” and so forth, however, will dramatically increase your speed because these words compose a large percentage of everything we type.

#### Text Expansion

If you really want to ramp up the speed, you should use text expansion to abbreviate at least the first couple hundred most common words and phrases in English, making, for example, “the” just “t”, “I want to” just “iwt”, and so on. By doing this alone, you can cut down on how many keys you have to physically press down by a huge percentage (at least for prose). You can actually do the same thing for common code constructs (e.g., the basic syntax of a for loop in Python), email signatures, and really anything else you can think of. Since I’m on Windows, I personally use AutoHotkey for this purpose, but there are plenty of options for this sort of thing. If your keyboard supports it, you may be able to do text expansion on the firmware level, making it operating system and device agnostic.

Just like normal typing, you’ll need to practice this intentionally to get results, retraining your hands to type “t” every time your brain thinks “the”. You’ll also want to create a “theory” for your abbreviations, and come up with some patterns to reuse as your list grows (e.g., using consistent letter sequences for phrase enders — “iwt” for “I want to”, “hwt” for “he wants to”, “swt” for “she wants to”, etc.). A working knowledge of a brief-heavy stenographic theory will help you here.

#### Modal Text Editing

Whether you code or not, you should consider learning [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) bindings and modal text editing. While I explicitly optimized for some of Vim’s bindings (more on the reasoning for that later — specifically why I chose to attach myself to the Vim framework instead of building my own syntax from the ground up), learning them on any layout is much, much, better than being stuck in the land of GUIs and text editing by mouse. Vim happens to be very well laid out for QWERTY since it was designed for QWERTY, but other layouts like Colemak can easily adapt to it as well.

In terms of implementing this, I would suggest you not pick up vanilla Vim or gVim, but rather [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) (which uses Emacs’ evil mode to emulate Vim commands) or [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) (which improves on many of Vim's strengths and brings it into the 21st century).

Because of [Org Mode](http://orgmode.org/), its support for non-leader key remapping of commands, and mnemonic key sequences for specialized commands (such as window commands), I personally believe Spacemacs is the superior choice for most people and situations. However, many others like [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) combined with [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) and [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/). In my opinion, the decision between these two setups mostly comes down to how much you use Org Mode -- since I use Org Mode for basically everything that's not code, I use Spacemacs.

#### Symbol Layers

You can create layers for numbers and symbols (putting them on the home row or at least in favorable positions) while still using QWERTY for letters. These additional layers have nothing to do with letter layouts.

#### Conclusion

Most speed considerations are layout agnostic. If you are already a sufficiently fast typist with another layout, the opportunity cost of retraining may be better spent beefing up your current toolkit and optimizing other parts of your typing. No matter what you do, dedicated *intentional* practice can significantly improve your typing, and you shouldn’t switch without first considering if it is really the most rational decision under your circumstances. For the reasons why you *should* switch, read on.

## Unorganized Thoughts

### Tap vs. hold:

- For the sake of easy numbers, let’s assume a few things:
   - Selecting a key to press takes 0.25 seconds (the decisionmaking time to press this key instead of that key )
      - The decisionmaking time for a second down movement of a key will be less, assuming the presses are next to each other in the key-stream (i.e., aa or aba instead of abca or abcda). Presses directly contiguous take between 0 and 0.125 seconds rather than normal 0.25; presses indirectly contiguous take between 0.125 and 0.25 seconds. These reductions are due to the fact that the cognitive load of this second press is less than acquiring an entirely different key to press.
   - The decisionmaking process for pressing down another key begins as soon as the down movement for the prior key begins, or, in the case of a key getting pressed for a second time, as soon as the first up movement is completed, or, in the case of same finger, as soon as the up movement of the first key is completed.
   - each down movement takes 0.25 seconds to complete 
      - Deciding to release a key takes 0 seconds if done immediately after pressing it, and between 0 and 0.125 seconds if not done immediately after pressing it.
   - Each up movement takes 0.25 seconds to complete
   - For cases of same finger, it takes between 0.125 and 0.25 seconds to move the finger in question from one location to another

- yy
- jj
- xx
- qq

### Available double-tap triggers when not in code mode:
- ((
- ‘’

Not in code mode: keyboard/program keeps track if inside unclosed quotes, “ key will then use single quote to automatically nest (allows us to use ‘ key in accents). “” —> “‘

Redesign Vim modal editing by matching most frequent commands to most frequent letters/symbols, assuming that these letters will be placed in favorable positions on kb layouts, making the vim bindings (relatively) layout independent. < Job for more dedicated/full-time person

Placement of sym layer with right thumb because sym will not be prepended/followed by numbers which require right thumb while code can be (e.g., [1, 2, 3] or 5>3). Assuming accessing shift layer not much difference between code and sym layers.

Command keys (Enter, Tab, Bkspc, Del) go on outer pinkies because don’t want to press them accidentally, not used in rolls/key combinations. Enter goes opposite punctuation. Also frequency considerations.

Punctuation always followed by space/enter can go on shift layer off home row since won’t mess with same finger for most circumstances (: used as punc goes here — used as leader, accessed on number layer — typical disadvantages from holding down don’t apply with thumb key never followed by space). - also goes here so it can be accessed by leader in a home position instead of only accessible by hold-down on middle finger extension. Esc on this layer too.

/ on left due to URLS: more words starting/ending with consonants than vowels (?)

## Other Languages: Goal

To be able to type Latin, German, French, Italian, and Spanish on the normal English layer without dead keys or other complicated methods of character entry and without interfering with Markdown, Org, or LaTeX markup syntax. As much as allowable by optimization constraints, the characters should be easy to memorize (:e —> ë rather than ^e —> ë) and consistent (if ]e —> œ, then it would make sense to use ]a —> æ; pattern: ] + letter —> ligature).

### Character priority:

- ,{letter}
- .{letter}
- ){letter}
- {letter}(
- ‘{letter}
- :{letter}  =  {letter}\`
- characters on non-thumb keys on Code and Sym layers, prioritized by memorability (see below)

Can’t use $ (thumb key > other fingers) since it is used in LaTeX for the inline/display modes of mathematical expressions. (It would be possible to track the opening/closing similar to \` code blocks in MD, but in some circumstances you might want to retain the ability to write accents within an expression.)

Thus far in my layout, ,{letter} is being used to jump into the navigation layer/toggle normal mode in Vim, .{letter} is being used to jump into Greek/Hebrew mode, and ){letter} is being used in command mode. The navigation and command modes are obviously more important than diacritics, and for me the Greek/Hebrew mode is more important as well since I type these languages more frequently than non-English languages with the Latin alphabet (including Latin itself). YMMV

### Memorability considerations:
- \| looks like a macron
- ( looks like a breve or inverted breve
- ) looks like a breve or inverted breve
- { looks kind of like a caron
- } looks kind of like a caron
- : looks like an umlaut/a dieresis
- A typographically smartened ‘ in the middle of a word looks like an acute accent (ex’ample)
- \` looks like a grave accent
- ^ looks like a circumflex accent for Latin scripts (the Greek/Cyrillic circumflex is a tilde accent or inverted breve) or inverted caron
- ~ looks like a tilde accent/the top part of the Spanish letter eñe (ñ)
- The Spanish letter eñe (ñ) looks like n
- , looks like the tail used to form a French c-cedilla (ç), a Romanian t-comma (ț), and a Romanian s-comma (ș).
- A c-cedilla (ç) looks like c, a t-comma (ț) looks like t, and an s-comma (ș) looks like s.
- The German ß is phonetically similar to s, but looks kind of like a capital B
- / looks like the slash in the Norwegian/Danish ø
- \ looks like the slash in the Norwegian/Danish ø, except facing the wrong way
- 0 looks like the circle above the Norwegian/Danish/Swedish å
- The Spanish inverted question mark (¿) looks like ?
- The Spanish inverted exclamation mark (¡) looks like !

### Accents

(in order of frequency: Latin > German, French, Italian > Spanish; presupposing prose mode not code mode; organized by decreasing freq. below)

- macron
   - o(
   - ( never used after letter
- acute accent
   - ‘o
   - ‘ only used before t, s, ve
- umlaut/dieresis
   - :o
   - : never used before letter
- grave accent
   - o\`
   - \` after resets hand for next, code
- circumflex
   - ^o
   - ^ before follows superscript ^{}

Track open \`code blocks\` (markdown) similar to open “. Code mode activated (and hence accents disabled, including grave) in open code blocks.

Brackets are not used with numerical superscripts (e.g., 1.2 x 10^8) in normal use. However, when the superscript is text, brackets become necessary to eliminate ambiguity: this^superscripted text vs. this^{superscripted text}. Thus, ^ before will never cause conflicts since text based superscripts will always use brackets.

No breve is needed since the absence of a macron indicates a short syllable.

### Letters and Ligatures 

(in order of frequency: Latin > German, French, Italian > Spanish; presupposing prose mode not code mode)

German

- ß eszett
   - s(
   - ( >> ‘ for these: ‘s, bot diag>top

French

- ç c-cedilla
   - c(
- œ oe ligature
   - ]e
   - ] before rather than [ after avoids SF
- æ ae ligature
   - ]a 

Spanish

- ñ eñe
   - n(
- ¿ inverted ?
   - ?{letter}
- ¡ inverted !
   - !{letter}

You should customize the typing of diacritics for your use case by looking at character frequency. Since most folks have no use for an automatic layer for Greek/Hebrew and also don’t need macrons, .{letter} and {letter}( should be used for different things.

## Hotstrings/Briefs

KB Briefing: Python script, top 100 or 200 words by freq in english language, use csv file to list word and possible briefs, check possible briefs against Spanish/French/Italian/German/Latin words, use script to match up (non-conflicting) possible briefs to the words that lead to the maximum amount of typing saved.

## AHK Dual Script Modding

- Sending key combinations in combinators
- Being able to easily toggle how Dual sends keys (send-mode input vs send-mode event).
- Making it easy to make all keys (even those that are not dual role keys) send their character on key-up rather than key-down. Consistency would make the “lag effect” (which lessens the faster you go) much easier to bear at slower speeds.
- Figure out non-base-layer hotstrings. Also figure out how to send key combinations in key sequences (e.g., Ctrl+Bkspc, Ctrl+Del).
- Hotstrings for “. o” —> O etc. (auto-capitalize first words of sentences)? Do with foreign letters too?
- Make shift work with macroned letters etc.
- Alt lock (for unicode symbols)?
