## Factors

- different factors for different items
- weighting of factors depending on individual circumstances
- separating optimality and cost â€” cost as factor, and to what extent it should be weighted as a factor

## Selection

- Very rare to find a product that actally meets your optimal configuration
- product spaces and figuring out what to choose among a range of suboptimal choices
- crowdsourcing as a solution to to the lack of effective product designs in much of industry
