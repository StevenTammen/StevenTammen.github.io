## Current Pick

[Glock 19](https://us.glock.com/products/model/g19) (with [Apex Trigger](https://store.apextactical.com/WebDirect/Products/Details/192369), [Trijicon RMR Sight](https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=RM05G), [Crimson Trace Auto-On Weapon Light](https://www.crimsontrace.com/01-7040), [LaserMax Guide Rod Laser](http://www.lasermax.com/products/guide-rod-lasers/lms-1131g))

## Caliber

- 9mm for compromise between weight, capacity, muzzle velocity (less drop at distance)
- Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP) rounds nullify many of the advantages that .45 has over 9mm, namely, less overpenetration and wider wound paths (more stopping power).
- Cheaper for plinking

## Frame

- Want a double stack for capacity. Makes EDCing a spare mag uneccessary (plus not having to change for more shots is faster than having to change).
- Big enough to hold comfortably, but small enough to be easily concealable. Mid range barrel length for best compromise between muzzle velocity/resistance to flip and recoil and concealability.
- Low bore axis
- Polymer frame for weight

## TODO

- Do tritium/fiber optic Trijicon optic sights wash out (worse than LED optic sights) in light? (Esp. illumination from weapon light in dark room ahead)?
