## Planned Contributions: Waffle.io

Kanban-like boards have been utilized by agile software development teams for years, and they have made the leap into business organization as well. I am fully convinced that they are the best solution to organizing cross-functional teams of people in parallel, especially when there is no heirarchichal leadership structure. They are a perfect match for managing the workflows of open source projects that are organized horizontally.

There are many proprietary options to choose from (such as [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [LeanKit](https://leankit.com/), [KanbanTool](http://kanbantool.com/), [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com/), etc.), but I wanted to choose something that was open source at its core, so the project managment for this site is done through [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/).

You can see this site's Waffle.io board [here](https://waffle.io/StevenTammen/steventammen.github.io). The board shows all of the things that I am currently working on, plan to work on, etc. -- both for content and design. Put simply, this is where you should start if you want to contribute to this site, because this is the roadmap for the future. If you see something you want to help with, go for it! (I'll explain how in a second).

Over time, if you take on an active role in development, I'll add you as a collaborator on GitHub, and you'll be able to edit pages and the Waffle.io board directly, with write permissions to the repository.

This is the side of contribution that is structured: everyone works together to achieve planned goals in an orderly fashion.

## Ad Hoc Contributions

Things can also be improved over time without any sort of overarching plan to bind contributions together: "organic growth", if you will. If there is something about the content or design of the site that you think could be done better, that is valid grounds for contributing. Nothing on this site is off limits -- you are free to contribute, as you see fit, in whatever way you want, pending my approval. Below are some examples of what *ad hoc* contributions could look like.

Example Content Contributions:

- Eliminating typos
- Eliminating unecessary verbosity or denseness of prose
- Improving phrasing, flow, or pacing
- Replacing technical jargon and unecessarily large words with more universally understood synonyms
- Splitting up unecessarily long sentences into forms easier to follow, i.e., simplifying syntax as appropriate
- Adding visual aids, such as diagrams, to enhance comprehension
- Anything else you think could make the content better

Example Design Contributions:

- Improving the desktop UX
- Improving the mobile UX
- Improving accessibility
- Adding customization options for various aspects of the site's appearance and functionality
- Anything else you think could make the site better

This is the side of contribution that is unstructured: individuals contribute over time to make the site better.

## How To Contribute With Respect To Content

At the top of every page I have included two buttons that link to its [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) source: one links to the page's location in the site's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/StevenTammen/steventammen.github.io) and the other links to the page's location on [Prose.io](http://prose.io/), an online markdown editor for GitHub.

You can help improve the site's content by submitting pull requests with editorial changes on Github, or by editing the pages on Prose.io and then pressing "Save" --> "Submit Change Request", which will automatically create the pull request for you. Prose.io is great if you don't have a lot of experience with Git and GitHub -- even though you need a GitHub account to propose changes through Prose.io, you need no other knowledge, so once you [set up a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), you can contribute freely without having to know all the complicated programmer stuff. If you aren't comfortable contributing through GitHub or Prose.io, you can also just email improvements to <a href="mailto:edits@steventammen.com">edits@steventammen.com</a>.

At the present time, I am not aware of any easy way for me to make content editable in a rich text environment, so if you want to contribute through GitHub or Prose.io, you are going to have to learn the basics of [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). You won't have to know anywhere near the whole specification to help -- if you skim the sections related to paragraphs, links, lists, and emphasis and you should have a good working knowledge in just a few minutes.

## How To Contribute With Respect To Design

You can help improve the site itself by submitting pull requests with design improvements. If you are comfortable with web development languages but not GitHub pull requests, you can send implementations to <a href="mailto:design@steventammen.com">design@steventammen.com</a> and I'll incorporate them into the repository myself. If you aren't comfortable with web development languages or GitHub pull requests, your ideas are still valuable, and you can send them to that same address.

For pull requests requiring significant amounts of work, it would be a good idea to check with me early on to make sure I approve of the changes or enhancements being considered. I don't want to put you in a situation where you put a lot of work into something that I wouldn't ultimately use.

## Benevolent Dictator For Life Powers

Like Python's Guido van Rossum and Vim's Bram Moolenaar, this site has a Benevolent Dictator For Life: me. I love working with others collaboratively, but ultimately, decisions about the direction of this site come down to me. In particular, this means that I will choose what gets written about, and choose which improvements find their way into the main repository.

I do not view this as limiting. If there is something that you are really passionate about but I am not, it is better all the way around if you create a site of your own to write about it (I'd be happy to help and contribute!). Because of how I have licensed everything, you are free to borrow as much of this site's design and content as you wish, as long as you give proper attribution and license the same way.

What I envision, in the long run, is a community of people writing about the things they are passionate about, freely helping each other improve while at the same time maintaining their own autonomy. This encourages the collaboration that open source projects are known for without causing the conflicts of leadership that they are also known for (for just one example, cf. Vim and NeoVim).
