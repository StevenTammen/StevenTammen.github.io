## Workflow

Kanban-like boards have been utilized by agile software development teams for years, and they have made the leap into business organization as well. I am fully convinced that they are the best solution to organizing cross-functional teams of people in parallel, especially when there is no heirarchichal leadership structure. They are a perfect match for managing the workflows of open source projects that are organized horizontally.

There are many proprietary options to choose from (such as [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [LeanKit](https://leankit.com/), [KanbanTool](http://kanbantool.com/), [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com/), etc.), but I wanted to choose something that was open source at its core, so the project managment from this ste is done through [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/).

You can see the Waffle.io board for this site here. If you wish to contribute, you're going to have to get added as a contributor by me, so shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:workflow@steventammen.com">workflow@steventammen.com</a>, or message me on GitHub, and I'll get you direct access to the board. If you don't want to play such an active role, you can always just let me know your thoughts and opinions about what should be covered in what order by emailing that same address.

## Content

At the top of every page I have included two buttons that link to its [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) source: one links to the page's location in the site's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/StevenTammen/steventammen.github.io) and the other links to the page's location on [Prose.io](http://prose.io/), an online markdown editor for GitHub.

You can help improve the site's content by submitting pull requests with editorial changes on Github, or by editing the pages on Prose.io and then pressing "Save" --> "Submit Change Request", which will automatically create the pull request for you. Prose.io is great if you don't have a lot of experience with Git and GitHub -- even though you need a GitHub account to propose changes through Prose.io, you need no other knowledge, so once you [set up a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), you can contribute freely without having to know all the complicated programmer stuff. If you aren't comfortable contributing through GitHub or Prose.io, you can also just email improvements to <a href="mailto:content@steventammen.com">content@steventammen.com</a>.

At the present time, I am not aware of any easy way for me to make content editable in a rich text environment, so if you want to contribute through GitHub or Prose.io, you are going to have to learn the basics of [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). You won't have to know anywhere near the whole specification to help -- if you skim the sections related to paragraphs, links, lists, and emphasis and you should have a good working knowledge in just a few minutes.

Example Content Improvements:

- Eliminating typos
- Eliminating unecessary verbosity or denseness of prose
- Improving phrasing, flow, or pacing
- Replacing technical jargon and unecessarily large words with more universally understood synonyms
- Splitting up unecessarily long sentences into forms easier to follow, i.e., simplifying syntax as appropriate
- Adding visual aids, such as diagrams, to enhance comprehension
- Anything else you think could make the content better

## Design

You can help improve the site itself by submitting pull requests with design improvements. If you are comfortable with web development languages but not GitHub pull requests, you can send implementations to <a href="mailto:design@steventammen.com">design@steventammen.com</a> and I'll incorporate them into the repository myself. If you aren't comfortable with web development languages or GitHub pull requests, your ideas are still valuable, and you can send them to that same address.

Example Design Improvements:

- Improving the desktop UX
- Improving the mobile UX
- Improving accessibility
- Anything else you think could make the site better

For pull requests requiring significant amounts of work, it would be a good idea to check with me early on to make sure I approve of the changes or enhancements being considered. I don't want to put you in a situation where you put a lot of work into something that I wouldn't ultimately use.
