## Frequency
- Disambiguation of homophones/briefing most common usage
- Creation of coda sounds (/th/, /nk/, /mp/, etc.) second most common usage
- Capitalization least common usage

## Layout On Stenotype
- Left pinky extension keys worst location
   - ⇒ capitalization goes here
   - For things without capitalization, used for additional disambiguators
   - In other words, if there is any capitalization, it will go on left pinky for consistency, otherwise, those keys are freed up to use for alternate forms/briefs
- Right index column second best location
   - Coda pinky extension keys (-D, -Z) more common than capitalization/additional disambiguation ⇒ finger contortion minimized by having more index extension on side with less pinky extension (i.e., not on this side)
   - ⇒ Creation of coda sounds goes here
      - Also, makes logical/intuitive sense to have modifier keys on the same side as the coda keys to make modified coda sounds (with the exception of S*, but whatever)
- Left index column best location
   - ⇒ Disambiguation/briefing goes here

## Top key on coda side
- Can be used as third disambiguator key all the time except when -F is stroked as part of the coda, at which point + acts as a coda sound creator (i.e., acts as if it were \*)
- In other words, -+F____ will create coda sounds, -+____ will act as disambiguator

## Basic Usage
- Disambiguation/briefing priority: prioritize left index bottom > left index top > right index top > left pinky bot > left pinky top.
Hand ergonomics: bottom index/pinky better than top index/pinky (flexion > contraction for these fingers), even if adjacent middle/ring finger on top. Test for yourself.
   - Always consistent order for what keys gets used, no more ambiguity. Can use additional disambiguation keys to create identical forms if they are not needed to disambiguate ("mis-strokes", if you will).
- Symbol legibility, in my opinion, goes in the order of ^ > \* > ~ > + > = > \# > other things like @%$& etc. Can change if you disagree.

## Example

The following words present a good test case: mat, Matt, matte, math, meat, meet, mete, Meath (the county in Ireland), and meeth (an archaic name for mead)

## Accounting For Finger Use

If finger(s) are needed for keys in their column(s), there are still ways to disambiguate:

Left Index Top (H)

- Chord With ~
- +
- =
- \#

Left Index Bot (R)

- Chord With ^
- +
- =
- \#

Right Index Top (-F)

- \^
- ~
- =
- \#

Right Index Bot (-R)

- \^
- ~
- =
- \#

Left Index Top (H) and Right Index Top (-F)

- Chord with ~
- =
- \#

Left Index Bot (R) and Right Index Top (-F)

- Chord with ^
- =
- \#

Left Index Top (H) and Right Index Bot (-R)

- Chord with ~
- =
- \#

Left Index Bot (R) and Right Index Bot (-R)

- Chord with ^
- =
- \#

Left Index Top (H), Right Index Top (-F), Left Pinky Top (S)

- Chord With ~
- Chord With \#

Etc.
