## Outline

Below I will attempt to show that absolute morality exists, that life is meaningful, and that individual life purpose exists and is knowable. My argument is structured in the following way:

1. There is such a thing as absolute morality
2. There is such a thing as meaning in life
3. There is such a thing as individual life purpose
4. Individual life purpose is knowable

## There is such a thing as absolute morality

Strict materialists often argue that existence is actually futile and that the meaningfulness of life is a charade that we keep up to numb ourselves to the coldness of reality. Under such a supposition, morality is seen through a subjective lens, a human construct propogated by the weak to keep the strong from ruling them absolutely. There is no right and wrong because the universe is governed by uncaring natural laws and humans humans are merely strings of predictable biological cause and effect drifting to and fro by chance.

I will argue in no uncertain terms that this particular position (i.e., a rejection of absolute morality) is incorrect. This does not *ipso facto* disprove strict materialism, but it does demand an explanation for why absolute morality exists. (In other words, strict materialism is not inherently incompatible with absolute morality, but the latter does not obviously flow from the former, and thus its origin must be exlained). The interaction between strict materialism and absolute morality is ultimately a separate issue.

The argument:

1) If absolute morality does not exist, then there is no rational basis for declaring any action worse than any other action.
2) Some actions are worse than other actions.
3) Therefore, absolute morality exists.

### Propositon 1

In propositional logic, the first propistion is what is known as an *implication*. If we let a = "absolute morality exists" and w = "there is a rational basis for declaring an action worse than another action," then proposition one can be written out formally as "not a implies not w" or "not w is necessary for not a." Here is the truth table for this particular implication:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>a</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>¬a</th>
    <th>¬w</th>
    <th>¬a → ¬w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the implication holds, then any time ¬a is true, ¬w must also be true (hence why say that ¬w is *necessary* for ¬a). To argue that the implication does not hold would require another basis than morality for evaluating things as "better" and "worse." In fact, many philosophers have attempted over the years to convince us that behavior can be classified as better or worse using ethics without any moral judgements of right or wrong being necessary (for example, actions that maximize the pleasure and minimize the pain of the most people are "better"). By engaging in a healthy amount of sophistry and redirection, sometimes it appears that there are no moral underpinnings to such arguments. However, morality is inescapable. Why should pleasure be maximized instead of pain? Is it not because maximizing pain for the most people is "bad" while maximizing pleasure for the most people is "good"?

### Proposition 2

Proposition 2 can be shown to be true using a simple [*reductio ad absurdum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) argument:

If no actions are worse than any other actions, then [insert terrible action] is no worse than saving starving children.

Here's some examples to put in the [insert terrible action] slot:

* Torturing puppies
* Killing people simply because they are different than you (in race, ethinicity, etc.)
* Raping and murdering preganant women
* etc.

If you seriously want to argue that torturing puppies is no worse than saving starving children that is your perogative. This proposition is necessary for the rest of the argument on this page, so you can go ahead and ignore my conclusions if you like.

Perhaps you have yourself convinced that my response to such atrocities is simply a product of cultural indoctrination from childhood (etc.). I might suggest that you have never been inside my head: the way that murdered children make me feel -- the way my blood rises, the way my fists clench, the way my eyes flash darkly -- this is not a product of manufactured societal propogranda. It's real.

I can accept that you may not feel the same way (i.e., that this *reductio ad absurdum* argument relies on a subjective experience and therefore is not logically certain), but that doesn't make me wrong. Just because humans can learn to sear their consciences over time does not mean that they do not exist in the first place.

### Conclusion

The conclusion follows because we have established that a) the implication holds, and that b) w is true (i.e., "there is a rational basis for declaring an action worse than another action"). If you look at the single row in the truth table for which the implication holds and w is true, ¬a is false, and a is true. In other words, absolute morality exists.

## There is such a thing as meaning in life

This argument should require a little less explanation:

1. Absolute morality exists
2. Humans are capable of discerning right from wrong
3. Discerning right from wrong is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right
4. Doing right is the source of true meaning in life
5. Therefore, it is possible for life to have meaning

### Proposition 1

We just proved this above. Implicit in this proposition are the existence of two categories called "right" and "wrong," which are central to the rest of the argument.

### Proposition 2

I hold that this proposition is self-evident. Our entire justice system, for example, is based upon the assumption that this is true.

While this proposition does not need to be true 100% of the time for the argument to hold, I personally believe that it is actually true 100% of the time. People know what is right and wrong in their hearts, even if all the world tells them otherwise. No person who ran a concentration camp in Germany, for example, could use the "but they told me it was right" excuse to defend their behavior -- even though their whole higher governmental system told them it was right, they still knew it was wrong. At least in my opnion.

### Proposition 3

We can put this into propositional logic like the implication of the argument above. If d = "I discern right from wrong" and r = "I do right," then this implication reads "r implies d." Here's the truth table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>d</th>
    <th>r → d</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that this implication does not hold if it is possible to do right without discerning right from wrong. As I mentioned above, I don't believe that it is possible for humans to not know right from wrong (which would obviate the need for an explanaton here since d would always be true, and thus the implication always true). However, for those that do not believe this, it is still possible to show that the implication holds.

A counterexample someone might use of a person doing right without discerning right from wrong is a gang lord paying rent on his drug warehouses, thereby supporting the education of local orphans. "Aha!" they say, "the gang lord is doing right by supporting the education of local orphans." I submit that the gang lord is not inherently doing right because his actions end up supporting the education of local orphans (a consequece he may not even know about).

To look at this another way, let's flip the situation and suggest that someone could do wrong by association. For example, a taxi driver unknowingly takes a psychopath to the house of his ex-wife who spurned him. The next day the woman is found brutally raped and murdered. Did the taxi driver do wrong? If you are to argue that the gang lord did right above, you would also have to argue that the taxi driver did wrong here. Not only that, for our law system to be just, the taxi driver ought to be punished for his wrongdoing.

Of course, the tricky thing here is that some gang lords might actually pay rent on their drug warehouses to suport the education of orphans (maybe because they grew up an orphan themselves they chose drug warehousing locations that would enable them to pay rent to an orphanage), and that some taxi drivers might actually drive a psychopath to his ex-wife's house in full knowledge of the possible outcome (maybe because he is the greedy younger brother of the ex-wife who stands to inherit her estate). You see, whether or not people do right and wrong is not independent from their intentions.

In philosophy this is the debate between [consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) and [deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics). If you are a strict consequentialist then consequences alone determine right and wrong and this implication does not hold. Most people, myself included, are not strict consequentialists.

It's worth pointing out that deontology does not entirely ignore consequences, merely that right and wrong are functions of *intended* consequences rather than *actual* consequences. It's also worth pointing out that moral absolutism (as argued for above) and deontology are not mutually exclusive if you view right and wrong as a composite of intent and absolute moral law. For example, stealing to feed one's family is understandable but still wrong, because stealing is universally wrong (stealing has negative absolute moral value). In our example above about the taxi driver, intent determines morality because driving a taxi has no negative absolute moral value. Both absolute morality and intent play a role.

I say negative absolute moral value because right is never determined by action alone, and is thus always subject to intent and the constraints of deontology. In other words, there is no such thing as a positive absolute moral value because doing something with positive consequences for the wrong reasons is still not right, even though it may not be wrong. For example, giving money ostentatiously to the poor may not be right, but it is not wrong either. Therefore, since giving money to the poor is not universally right, it does not have positive absolute moral value. A similar argument can be used for other cases.

Put into logical terms we may understand moral action in the following way -- if n = "I do something with a negative absolute moral value," i = "I have right intent," r = "I do right," and w = "I do wrong," then:

1. n implies w

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>n</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>n → w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that the implication allows for a situation in which someone does not do something with a negative absolute moral value but still does something wrong.

2. r is equivalent to ¬n and i

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>n</th>
    <th>i</th>
    <th>¬n</th>
    <th>¬n ∧ i</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that the only way to do right is to not do something with negative absolute moral value and to do something with right intent.

3. ¬r is not equivalent to w

When we are saying two propositions are not equivalent, what we are really saying is that the two propositions are not necessary and sufficient for each other in all cases -- or, to speak in terms of propositonal logic, that the logical biconditional of two propositions is not always true (i.e., a tautology). (If p and q are propositions, biconditionality is defined as (p → q) ∧ (q → p)). 

In this case something being "not right" is not a necessary and sufficient condition for being "wrong" in all cases, shown by the false values in the biconditional:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>¬r</th>
    <th>¬r ↔ w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>








People will often come up with thought experiments where they attempt to show that the two are incompatible -- for example, lying to the Nazis about the religion of your Jewish neighbors to save them from execution. The problem is that this approach almost invariably straw man's the moral absolutists' position. In the example above, I, as a moral absolutist, have no problem with lying to evil people or enemy nations (that is counterintelligence in a nutshell, after all). In other words, while I may be absolute in the idea that there is right and wrong for any given situation, it does not mean that 



All such examples engage in what I call "result substitution," wherein a positive outcome of some action is attributed to the agent of the action. The problem here is that, technically speaking, the agent did *not* do the outcome, he did the action. So unless the action itself was right, the agent did not do right.





  
  - If the universe is governed by uncaring natural laws (i.e., humans are merely strings of predictable biological cause and effect drifting to and fro by chance), what basis have we for finding personal meaning in life? If the universe is governed by an all-powerful diety, does this actually translate into a basis for finding personal meaning in life?
  - (Assuming personal meaning in life does exist and is knowable)
  If God does not exist, is there such a thing as absolute morality?
