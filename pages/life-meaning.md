## Outline

Below I will attempt to show that absolute morality exists, that life is meaningful, and that individual life purpose exists and is knowable. My argument is structured in the following way:

1. Absolute Morality exists
2. Doing right is a source of legitimate purpose in life
3. Individual life purpose exists
4. Individual life purpose is knowable

## Argument 1: Absolute morality exists

Strict materialists often argue that existence is actually futile and that the meaningfulness of life is a charade that we keep up to numb ourselves to the coldness of reality. Under such a supposition, morality is seen through a subjective lens, a human construct propogated by the weak to keep the strong from ruling them absolutely. There is no right and wrong because the universe is governed by uncaring natural laws and humans humans are merely strings of predictable biological cause and effect drifting to and fro by chance.

I will argue in no uncertain terms that this particular position (i.e., a rejection of absolute morality) is incorrect. This does not *ipso facto* disprove strict materialism, but it does demand an explanation for why absolute morality exists. (In other words, strict materialism is not inherently incompatible with absolute morality, but the latter does not obviously flow from the former, and thus its origin must be exlained). The interaction between strict materialism and absolute morality is ultimately a separate issue.

The argument:

1. If absolute morality does not exist, then there is no rational basis for declaring any action worse than any other action.
2. Some actions are worse than other actions.
3. Therefore, absolute morality exists.

### Propositon 1

In propositional logic, the first propistion is what is known as an *implication*. If we let a = "absolute morality exists" and w = "there is a rational basis for declaring an action worse than another action," then proposition one can be written out formally as "not a implies not w" or "not w is necessary for not a." Here is the truth table for this particular implication:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>a</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>¬a</th>
    <th>¬w</th>
    <th>¬a → ¬w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the implication holds, then any time ¬a is true, ¬w must also be true (hence why say that ¬w is *necessary* for ¬a). To argue that the implication does not hold would require another basis than morality for evaluating things as "better" and "worse." In fact, many philosophers have attempted over the years to convince us that behavior can be classified as better or worse using ethics without any moral judgements of right or wrong being necessary (for example, actions that maximize the pleasure and minimize the pain of the most people are "better"). By engaging in a healthy amount of sophistry and redirection, sometimes it appears that there are no moral underpinnings to such arguments. However, morality is inescapable. Why should pleasure be maximized instead of pain? Is it not because maximizing pain for the most people is "bad" while maximizing pleasure for the most people is "good"?

### Proposition 2

Proposition 2 can be shown to be true using a simple [*reductio ad absurdum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) argument:

If no actions are worse than any other actions, then [insert terrible action] is no worse than saving starving children.

Here's some examples to put in the [insert terrible action] slot:

* Torturing puppies
* Killing people simply because they are different than you (in race, ethinicity, etc.)
* Raping and murdering preganant women
* etc.

If you seriously want to argue that torturing puppies is no worse than saving starving children that is your perogative. This proposition is necessary for the rest of the argument on this page, so you can go ahead and ignore my conclusions if you like.

Perhaps you have yourself convinced that my response to such atrocities is simply a product of cultural indoctrination from childhood (etc.). I might suggest that you have never been inside my head: the way that murdered children make me feel -- the way my blood rises, the way my fists clench, the way my eyes flash darkly -- this is not a product of manufactured societal propogranda. It's real.

I can accept that you may not feel the same way (i.e., that this *reductio ad absurdum* argument relies on a subjective experience and therefore is not logically certain), but that doesn't make me wrong. Just because humans can learn to sear their consciences over time does not mean that they do not exist in the first place.

### Conclusion

The conclusion follows because we have established that a) the implication holds, and that b) w is true (i.e., "there is a rational basis for declaring an action worse than another action"). If you look at the single row in the truth table for which the implication holds and w is true, ¬a is false, and a is true. In other words, absolute morality exists.

## Argument 2: Doing right is a source of legitimate purpose in life

1. If absolute morality exists, then doing right is a source of legitimate purpose in life
2. Absolute morality exists
3. Therefore, doing right is a source of legitimate purpose in life

### Proposition 1

If absolute morality exists, it is possible to find purpose in life by studying the laws of absolute morality and then [following them with right intent](https://steventammen.com/deontology/) (thereby doing right).

It is equally true that if absolute morality exists, it is possible to find purpose in life by studying the laws of absolute morality and then breaking them intentionally (thereby doing wrong).

### Proposition 2

Proved in argument 1.

### Conclusion

This is a form of logical deduction known as [*modus ponens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens).

## Argument 3: Individual life purpose exists

To prove that individual life purpose exists, we first start with an argument of the form "if A implies B, and A is equivalent to C, then C implies B."

1. Doing right is a source of legitimate purpose in life = if one does right, then one's life will have purpose
2. Doing right is equivalent to following absolute morality given individual circumstances
3. Therefore, if one follows absolute morality given individual circumstances, then one's life will have purpose

Proposition 1 is proved in argument 2, and proposition 2 is proved [here](https://steventammen.com/morality-and-individual-circumstances/).

If we define individual life purpose to be the set of normative ethics for one's individual circumstances, then 

## Argument 4: Individual life purpose is knowable

Given that individual life purpose exists, the only way that it would not be knowable is if individual life circumstances were not knowable



## 

1. (Absolute morality exists)
2. (Humans are capable of discerning right from wrong)
3. Discerning right from wrong is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right

### Proposition 1

We just proved this above. Implicit in this proposition are the existence of two categories called "right" and "wrong," which are central to the rest of the argument.

### Proposition 2

I hold that this proposition is self-evident. Our entire justice system, for example, is based upon the assumption that this is true.

While this proposition does not need to be true 100% of the time for the argument to hold, I personally believe that it is actually true 100% of the time. People know what is right and wrong in their hearts, even if all the world tells them otherwise. No person who ran a concentration camp in Germany, for example, could use the "but they told me it was right" excuse to defend their behavior -- even though their whole higher governmental system told them it was right, they still knew it was wrong.

### Proposition 3

We can put this into propositional logic like the implication of the argument above. If d = "I discern right from wrong" and r = "I do right," then this implication reads "r implies d." Here's the truth table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>d</th>
    <th>r → d</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that this implication does not hold if it is possible to do right without discerning right from wrong. As I mentioned above, I don't believe that it is possible for humans to not know right from wrong (which would obviate the need for an explanation here since d would always be true, and thus the implication always true). However, for those that do not believe this, it is still possible to show that the implication holds.

A counterexample someone might use of a person doing right without discerning right from wrong is a business owner paying rent on his warehouse that is owned by the man who runs the local orphanage, thereby supporting local orphans. "Aha!" they say, "the business owner is doing right by supporting local orphans." I submit that the business owner is not inherently doing right because his actions end up supporting the local orphans (a consequence he may not even know about).

Of course, the tricky thing here is that a business owner might actually pay rent on his warehouse in order to suport local orphans (maybe because he grew up an orphan himself he chose a location for a warehouse that would enable him to pay rent that would be used to support an orphanage). This case is different since the business owner's *intention* is right -- he knows about the warehouse owner's orphanage and is acting in support of it. To have right intent, however, he had to know what was right to begin with... meaning he had to discern right from wrong.

In philosophy the contrast introduced above revolves around the difference between [consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) and [deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics). If you are a strict consequentialist then consequences alone determine right and wrong and this implication does not hold. Most people, myself included, are not strict consequentialists.

It's worth pointing out that deontology does not entirely ignore consequences, merely that right and wrong are functions of *intended* consequences rather than *actual* consequences. It's also worth pointing out that moral absolutism (as argued for above) and deontology are not mutually exclusive if you view right and wrong as a composite of intent and absolute moral law. For example, stealing from one's neighbors to feed one's family is understandable but still wrong, because stealing from innocent people is universally wrong (stealing from innocent people has negative absolute moral value).

I say *negative* absolute moral value above because right is never determined by action alone, and is thus always subject to intent and the constraints of deontology. In other words, there is no such thing as a positive absolute moral value because doing something with positive consequences for unsound reasons is still not right, even though it may not be wrong. For example, giving money ostentatiously to the poor to be praised for one's generosity is not right (but it is not strictly wrong either). Therefore, since giving money to the poor is not universally right regardless of intent, it does not have positive absolute moral value. (A similar argument can be used in other cases to show that positive absolute moral values do not exist).

Put into logical terms we may understand moral action in the following way -- if n = "I do something with a negative absolute moral value," i = "I have right intent," r = "I do right," and w = "I do wrong," then:

1. n implies w

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>n</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>n → w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that the implication allows for a situation in which someone does not do something with a negative absolute moral value but still does something wrong (because of wrong intent).

2. ¬r is not equivalent to w

When we say two propositions are not equivalent, what we are really saying is that the two propositions are not necessary and sufficient for each other in all cases -- or, to speak in terms of propositonal logic, that the logical biconditional of two propositions is not always true (i.e., a tautology). (If p and q are propositions, biconditionality is defined as (p → q) ∧ (q → p)). 

In this case something being "not right" is not a necessary and sufficient condition for being "wrong" in all cases, demonstrated by the false values in the biconditional:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>¬r</th>
    <th>¬r ↔ w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that a similar argument can be used to show that ¬w is not equivalent to r.

3. r is equivalent to ¬n and i

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>n</th>
    <th>i</th>
    <th>¬n</th>
    <th>¬n ∧ i</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that the *only* way to do right is to not do something with negative absolute moral value and to do something with right intent.

Above I dealt with the objection of someone without right intent (i.e., someone who did not discern right from wrong) doing something that ended up having positive consequences (the business owner supporting the local orphans). Now that we have dealt with some more of the philosophy behind right and wrong, it is possible to see why such an objection is raised: by failing to recognize the possibility of action that is neither morally right nor morally wrong, people conflate situations that show a non-moral decisions having positive consequences without right intent with situations that show a moral decision having positive consequences without right intent. That is, they reason that because they can come up with examples of decisions having positive consequences without right intent, discerning right from wrong is not a necessary condition to doing right.

The flaw in this logic is that it implicitly presupposes that decisions without intent are moral decisions in the first place -- it substitutes strict consequentialism for deontology for all decisions that result in positive consequences. Now, this is well and good if one actually holds to strict consequentialism, but if you purport to hold to deontology (at eat in general), but then selectively decide that intent is not necessary for moral decisionmaking, then you are picking and choosing impermissably.

Brushing one's teeth for example, is not a moral decision in and of itself. But brushing one's teeth for the purpose of saving money in the long term (by avoid expensive dental care) so that you can have more resources to dedicate to your family is a moral decision that is right.





What the statement "it is possible for life to have meaning" is really saying is that 


2. Humans are capable of discerning right from wrong
3. Discerning right from wrong is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right
4. Doing right is a source of legitimate meaning in life


"Doing wrong is a source of legitimate purpose in life" is just as true a proposition as "doing right is a source of legitimate purpose in life." In other words, it is not doing right that gives life purpose, but following a set of normative ethics. (This being said, of course doing right is the correct path to take: while your life might have "purpose" if you strive to only do wrong, I would argue that such a situation is worse than not having purpose at all).


Note too that it is possible to do something without right *or* wrong intent, just how it is possible for actions to be "not right" without being "wrong." This is important in our discussion of whether it is possible to do right without discerning right from wrong: since discerning right from wrong is necessary for having right intent, and having right intent is necessary for doing right, then it follows that discerning right from wrong is necessary for doing right. *But this does not mean* that actions without right intent are *ipso facto* wrong, merely that they are not 

All this goes to show that it is not possible for someone to do right without discerning right from wrong because a necessary part of doing right is figuring out what is right and acting in such a way that (intent). This statement is true because not all decisions we make on a daily basis are moral decisions: for example, deciding to brush ones teeth with one's left hand instead of one's right hadn ahs no moral vaue








People will often come up with thought experiments where they attempt to show that the two are incompatible -- for example, lying to the Nazis about the religion of your Jewish neighbors to save them from execution. The problem is that this approach almost invariably straw man's the moral absolutists' position. In the example above, I, as a moral absolutist, have no problem with lying to evil people or enemy nations (that is counterintelligence in a nutshell, after all). In other words, while I may be absolute in the idea that there is right and wrong for any given situation, it does not mean that 



All such examples engage in what I call "result substitution," wherein a positive outcome of some action is attributed to the agent of the action. The problem here is that, technically speaking, the agent did *not* do the outcome, he did the action. So unless the action itself was right, the agent did not do right.





  
  - If the universe is governed by uncaring natural laws (i.e., humans are merely strings of predictable biological cause and effect drifting to and fro by chance), what basis have we for finding personal meaning in life? If the universe is governed by an all-powerful diety, does this actually translate into a basis for finding personal meaning in life?
  - (Assuming personal meaning in life does exist and is knowable)
  If God does not exist, is there such a thing as absolute morality?
