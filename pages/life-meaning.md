## Outline

Below I will attempt to show that absolute morality exists, that life is meaningful, and that individual life purpose exists and is knowable. My argument is structured in the following way:

1. There is such a thing as absolute morality
2. There is such a thing as meaning in life
3. There is such a thing as individual life purpose
4. Individual life purpose is knowable

## There is such a thing as absolute morality

Strict materialists often argue that existence is actually futile and that the meaningfulness of life is a charade that we keep up to numb ourselves to the coldness of reality. Under such a supposition, morality is seen through a subjective lens, a human construct propogated by the weak to keep the strong from ruling them absolutely. There is no right and wrong because the universe is governed by uncaring natural laws and humans humans are merely strings of predictable biological cause and effect drifting to and fro by chance.

I will argue in no uncertain terms that this particular position (i.e., a rejection of absolute morality) is incorrect. This does not *ipso facto* disprove strict materialism, but it does demand an explanation for why absolute morality exists. (In other words, strict materialism is not inherently incompatible with absolute morality, but the latter does not obviously flow from the former, and thus its origin must be exlained). The interaction between strict materialism and absolute morality is ultimately a separate issue.

The argument:

1) If there is no absolute morality, then there is no rational basis for declaring any action worse than any other action.
2) Some actions are worse than other actions.
3) Therefore, absolute morality exists.

### Propositon 1

In propositional logic, the first propistion is what is known as an *implication*. If we let p = "there is absolute morality" and q = "there is a rational basis for declaring an action worse than another action," then proposition one can be written out formally as "not p implies not q" or "not q is necessary for not p." Here is the truth table for this particular implication:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>p</th>
    <th>q</th>
    <th>¬p</th>
    <th>¬q</th>
    <th>¬p → ¬q</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the implication holds, then any time ¬p is true, ¬q must also be true (hence why say that ¬q is *necessary* for ¬p). To argue that the implication does not hold would require another basis than morality for evaluating things as "better" and "worse." In fact, many philosophers have attempted over the years to convince us that behavior can be classified as better or worse using ethics without any moral judgements of right or wrong being necessary (for example, actions that maximize the pleasure and minimizing the pain of the most people are "better"). By engaging in a healthy amount of sophistry and redirection, sometimes it appears that there are no moral underpinnings to such arguments. However, morality is inescapable. Why should pleasure be maximized instead of pain? Is it not because maximizing pain for the most people is "bad" while maximizing pleasure for the most people is "good"?

### Proposition 2

Proposition 2 can be shown to be true using a simple *reductio ad absurdum* argument:

If no actions are worse than any other actions, then [insert terrible action] is no worse than saving starving children.

Here's some examples to put in the [insert terrible action] slot:

* Torturing puppies
* Killing people simply because they are different than you (in race, ethinicity, etc.)
* Raping and murdering preganant women
* etc.

If you seriously want to argue that torturing puppies is no worse than saving starving children that is your perogative. This proposition is necessary for the rest of the argument on this page, so you can go ahead and ignore my conclusions if you like.

If you have yourself convinced that my response to such atrocities is simply a product of cultural indoctrination from childhood (etc.), I might suggest that you have never been inside my head. The way that murdered children make me feel -- the way my blood rises, the way my mouth pulls into a grimace, the way my eyes flash darkly -- this is not a product of manufactured societal propogranda. It's real.

I can accept that you may not feel the same way (i.e., that this *reductio ad absurdum* argument relies on a subjective experience and therefore is not logically certain), but that doesn't make me wrong. Just because humans can learn to sear their consciences over time does not mean that they do not exist in the first place.

### Conclusion

The conclusion follow





  
  - If the universe is governed by uncaring natural laws (i.e., humans are merely strings of predictable biological cause and effect drifting to and fro by chance), what basis have we for finding personal meaning in life? If the universe is governed by an all-powerful diety, does this actually translate into a basis for finding personal meaning in life?
  - (Assuming personal meaning in life does exist and is knowable)
  If God does not exist, is there such a thing as absolute morality?
