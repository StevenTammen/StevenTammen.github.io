## What Is Stenography And How Does It Compare To Typing?

In a vacuum, machine shorthand (aka stenography, commonly abbreviated "steno") is objectively superior to plain typing in just about every way. The world record for machine shorthand transcription is over 360 WPM. Think about that for a second. *Three hundred and sixty words per minute is mind-blowingly fast*.

If the idea of writing that fast intrigues you, you should read a series of articles -- starting [here](https://stenoknight.com/SpeakFingers.html) -- written by Mirabai Knight, the stenographer behind [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover) (a free, open source stenography program). Mirabai argues that there are reasons other than speed for steno (fluency of thought, for example). This is a good series, but strawmans keyboard layouts to an extent. For example, if in your typing you automatically space out punctuation and autocapitalize (just like stenography does), come up with shorthand forms for very common words and phrases (just like stenograpy does), and use a system of prefixes, suffixes, and phrase-enders according to personally-determined patterns (just like stenography does), all of the disparities cited in this series shrink significantly.

In other words, if you start comparing apples-to-apples, while stenography still wins overall since phonetic input will always be faster/more efficient than orthographic input, the differences are not nearly as vast as protrayed here. When I get the time I am going to go through the series point by point and highlight the observations and comparisons that don't apply to properly designed typing setups. (Note: I don't think Mirabai is at all at fault for making the observations and drawing the comparisons -- most people don't use keyboards particularly effectively, so her points stand in the vast majority of cases).

## The Opportunity Cost: Time Investment

If stenography is simply better in the abstract, even if not by as much as advertised, why shouldn't everybody learn it? Well, the thing is, learning stenography is more than just learning a different character layout. For example, you have to learn:

- How to press multiple keys at the same time (known as "chording"), sometimes with the same finger.
- How to consciously distinguish phonemes in pronunciation (everyone does this unconsciously, but most people don't have any practice thinking about it, much less translating it into hand positions).
- How to split words into syllabifications to match outlines in a given translation dictionary. (While translation dictionaries usually have outlines for multiple syllabifications, sometimes people will syllabify words in non-standard ways that aren't defined, and will need try other ways).
- How to deal with the word boundary conflicts introduced from phonetic writing (for example, "we walked around the *lighthouse*" vs. "we walked around the *light house*").
- How to deal with homophones (by, buy, bye; there, their, they're; etc.).
- How to write the full list of words without phonetic outlines (a condition known as "brief solitude"). Most of these are very high frequency words, which is both good and bad -- you'll basically have to learn them all before you can write anything, but you'll learn them fast since you'll need to use them a lot.
- etc.

This list isn't comprehensive. Stenography is an entirely different text-entry paradigm than typing, and for people without any linguistics experience, the majority of the concepts and vocabulary introduced will be things you've never heard of before.

The numbers vary on how long it takes for people to get to high speeds. There are people like [Stanley Sakai](http://stanographer.com/) who got to 225+ WPM in months. The thing is, Stan is also a polyglot (at the time of writing, listing proficiency in English, Korean, Dutch, German, Spanish, American Sign Language, and French on his resume), already knew pen shorthand (Gregg) when he started machine shorthand, and majored in linguistics in college. It took Mirabai a year and half to pass her 225's when studying part-time at a brick-and-mortar steno school. Ted Morin, Plover's current lead dev, has been practicing stenography for [about 3 years](https://www.facebook.com/morinted/posts/10152184434552401) and is currently around 160 WPM. From my understanding, these people are on the fast end of things. A slightly more pessimistic (though balanced, in my view) take on stenography learning times can be seen [here](http://careyryan.com/stenotype-can-we-type-much-faster/). Also have a look at the [most recent statistics related to the Open Steno Project's Community Survey](http://plover.stenoknight.com/2017/08/responses-to-2017-osp-community-survey.html).

## TODO: frontloaded learning and consistency (stenography) vs. adding efficiency over time and "intuitiveness" (smart typing)

- [An excellent thread on GeekHack](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=16927.0) where one person's super-efficient typing system comes up in conversation, and Stan Sakai chimes in.

## Who Should Use What

If you are in a field that could benefit from really fast input, there is nothing better than stenography. Such fields might include:

- Transcriptionists (of any type)
- Fields that require frequent "conversational" communication: emails, forums, IRC, etc. Steno shines in conversational contexts because we can easily talk and therefore think at 200+ WPM -- there are no mental speed restrictions in these contexts, so any input method slower than speech will be a speed bottleneck.
- Fields that requires real-time speeds. These would include traditional steno fields like court-reporting, captioning, CART, etc.

For basically everyone else, it's not worth learning stenography from a practical point of view (marginal benefit will never exceed marginal cost). I break here with Mirabai on the idea of writers and programmers learning stenography. Unless the majority of your writing is conversational (as mentioned above) or borders on conversational (such as writing character dialogue in novels), you will never be thinking at 200 WPM since you'll be considering word selection, connotation, tone, grammar, style, flow, etc. I also humbly submit that the idea that programmers think at 200 WPM is preposterous. I am studying computer science full time and am yet to come across someone who could even write pseudocode at anything approaching 200 WPM.

Writers and programmers would of course be able to get their thoughts on screen faster with stenography, theoretically with less disruption to the mental flow of ideas. Here's a good quote from Mirabai's series:

> I'm willing to bet that the act of qwerty typing slows down the thoughts of many people. When I type on a qwerty keyboard, I feel my mind splitting along four consecutive but overlapping tracks: One, the word I want to write. Two, the way it's spelled. I'm a pretty good speller, but English is weird enough that the process is never completely automatic. Three, the series of five to ten finger motions it takes to type it. Four, the error checking mechanism that iterates over the first three and confirms that the correct word choice, orthography, and letter position have appeared onscreen. Usually I'll have already started typing the next word when I spot a spelling or typing error in the previous one, and by the time I've pressed backspace ten times to correct two transposed letters, my train of thought will have gotten all tangled up and I'll have to pause for a second to remember what I was writing. Even when I try to pace myself and type more slowly than usual, I'll make an error like this every few sentences, and my flow of composition will have been interrupted half a dozen times by end of the paragraph. 

I am not aware of any evidence that meets my baseline standard (methodologically-sound, peer-reviewed, double-blind scientific studies conducted by qualified and respected researchers without conflicts of interest and funded by entities without an axe to grind) to either support or refute such speculation. Therefore, I leave judgement up to the reader. I am certain that Mirabai is right to an extent. I just don't think gains here will ever come close to offsetting the time required to learn stenography, especially since typing does not always have to be in the linear sense described here: the more briefs you use, the less typos, generally speaking, you will have, and the gap narrows. Intelligent use of Ctrl + Backspace will also make correction significantly less disruptive, since you just reset your string of thought at the word level (rather than the character level).

## Closing Thoughts

The decision to utilize stenography or ignore it is obviously a personal one. However, the community is super friendly and willing to answer questions. I recommend taking a look at the [Plover Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ploversteno) and [Discord Channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/136953735426473984/136953735426473984) to talk to individuals into steno. I have been involved in both communities for a couple years now, and have stuck around (at least to an extent) even after I stopped actively trying to learn stenography. (They even put up with my attempts to [improve the character layout](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ploversteno/-sowdKC_bjU%5B1-25%5D) and [improve stenographic input devices](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ploversteno/aJ6PNMlvLEs)).

One further note here: if you pick up steno as a hobby to have fun and relax, it will pay dividends better than most other hobbies, and it *might* become worth it. The marginal cost/marginal benefit number crunching above presupposes that the only relevant benefit of steno is increased efficiency in text input, which may or not be the case depending on the person.

### Mirbai: Part 1:



> Steno would almost certainly be a great help to people like Roger Ebert or Alan Doherty, though. They don't have lower jaws, but their fingers work just fine. Currently they're forced to type everything they want to say on an ordinary keyboard, either letter by letter or using predictive text systems, which require around three to four keystrokes per word. The very best qwerty typist can get up to around 130 words per minute, but normal conversational speed is usually around 180, and often goes as high as 260 words per minute. People who rely on qwerty keyboards to communicate face the choice either of playing back pre-written sentences or requiring long pauses between each sentence. Either way disrupts the natural rhythm of conversation. 

> Steno, by design, can be written as fast as English can be spoken. It also allows for greater fluency of thought (which I'll touch on more in the segment about writers and programmers), because it works syllabically rather than letter by letter. For instance, I'll take a random sentence:

> "Whether or not the application is completed depends on your full cooperation."

> That's 78 keystrokes on a qwerty keyboard. On a steno keyboard? Twelve strokes in all, making it over six times more efficient.

When Mirabai states that "the very best qwerty typist can get up to around 130 words per minute" she is talking about people who type every character linearly (which is most people). The thing is, there is absolutely no reason why the typing paradigm must be limited to typing out every character linearly. Stenography enables the use of briefs with chords -- typing can very easily do something similar with key sequences. This point will be continuously brought up in this series. Comparing *any* stenographic theory with briefs (which all of the major ones have, even the ones that strive to be more consistent than short in their writing, like Phoenix) to pure linear typing is not comparing apples to apples. It's like saying that electric bikes are way slower than electric scooters when you have imposed an artificial upper speed limit on electric bikes (say, 15 miles per hour). Sure, it's true, but it has more to do with what you're choosing to compare than the platforms of electric bikes and electric scooters. If you were to compare an "unhandicapped" electric bike with an electric scooter, the electric scooter would probably still be faster, but the difference would not be nearly so huge, and other factors (like weight, ease of transport in other vehicles, ease of storage when not in use, and so forth) might play a larger role when deciding between the two.

So too here. When you compare stenography *without* briefs to typing *without* briefs or stenography *with* briefs to typing *with* briefs (apples to apples), stenography will still come out on top every time. But the difference will not be as drastic.

Mirabai's example -- "Whether or not the application is completed depends on your full cooperation." -- could be written in the following way, for example: "Wton t ap is cpltd depends on ur fl coop." Using a text expansion program, this would automatically transform into the given phrase. Including a keystroke for capitalization (as Mirabai did in her keyboard total of 78, by my count at least), this takes exactly 42 characters to type. 42/78 = ~0.54, so this particular briefing scheme reduces the number of keystrokes by roughly half. Notice that this is still a lot more total strokes than stenography, but it's not nearly as big a difference as it was: stenography went from being 6.5 times more efficient to 3.5 times more efficient.

Comparing the number of stenographic strokes to the number of typing keystrokes to determine efficiency is a good way to see the relative amounts of effort required to write something, but there may be additional considerations that make the comparison more complex. This particular comparison has several implicit presuppositions: 1) it takes the same amount of time and effort to line up the hand for a steno stroke as a typing keystroke, 2) it takes the same amount of time and force to actuate the key(s), and 3) the stress put on the hand(s) from the strokes are comparable in magnitude. Since stenography has a different source of actuation force (the forearms) than typing (individual fingers), this obviously needs to be taken into account when discussing the above. I am unsure whether there are differences in typing or stenography in any of the three areas, and leave this determination to the reader. (There is no research on the subject that I am aware of, much less well-conducted, unbiased, methodologically-sound research).

> Once those two barriers [the costs of steno machines and steno software] are removed, I think the training will largely take care of itself. It took me a year and a half of intensive practice to get from 0 to 225 words per minute, but I was writing at 100 words per minute after only a few months, and that was true of nearly all my classmates as well. Steno is so vastly more efficient than qwerty that even a beginning stenographer can outstrip the best qwerty typist relatively quickly.

While I obviously agree with Mirabai in all respects about making stenography accessible, I am unsure that high entrance costs are why stenography has stayed in relative obscurity -- the prohibitive learning time might have something to with it too.  I have never been to stenography school (and thus wouldn't want to pretend to know what it's like for these folks), but I'm guessing the total time required to get to 100 WPM is at least 80 hours, and perhaps in the 100's of hours. (It will obviously depend on such factors as a person's dedication, consistency, inherent hand dexterity, etc.). If we call 100 WPM stenographers "beginning stenographers," then such folks still have quite a bit of training according to most people's standards.

Will all this being said, the idea Mirabai presents is still intriguing: for a moderate upfront time cost, most everyone could achieve a relatively effortless 100 WPM, with the potential to grow that over time. I'd wager that the time required to get to 100 WPM on keyboards (from scratch -- i.e., not knowing how to touch type) would still be less for most people -- particularly if people learned briefs for the most common English language lemmas which account for [about 50% of the words we type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English). I could be wrong too. Aside from anecdotal evidence, we don't have much to go on for how long it takes people to learn fast touch typing, and, importantly, how long it would take *these same people* to get up to middling speeds in stenography. Without a matched-pairs experimental group (and controlling for factors that would skew results, such as learner age/neuroplasticity, learner knowledge of linguistics, etc.), this sort of data has the potential to be very biased.

> Qwerty is a venerable and popular input system, but at its best it's only a third as efficient as human speech. Steno is every bit as efficient as human speech, and it's been forced into undeserved obscurity by its high entry cost and inaccessible design. Plover is an attempt to fix that. I'll keep you posted. 

Plover and the open hardware attached to the Open Steno Project have, thankfully, fixed the inaccessibility of steno. However, this paragraph is again running into the selective comparison problems discussed above. There are qwerty typists that can type at 130 WPM (which Mirabai herself mentions earlier in this post), which is definitely not only a third as fast as most people talk. If you add on a better-designed character layout and an intelligent text-expansion system, that number can go up by half again. See [this thread](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=16927.0) from GeekHack for an example. Stan Sakai also [chimes in](https://geekhack.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=14rml79j6ebvajeddbahekuuf63alb7p&topic=16927.msg421003#msg421003) with a lot of good thoughts on the two systems.

### Mirabai, part 2:


> Mainly it's just such an inefficient input mechanism. I already know the word I want to write when I type the first letter, but instead of moving on to the next word, I have to spend however many more fractions of a second typing out the rest of the letters, then pressing space, then starting on the second word. It artificially slows down my thinking and forces a staccato note into whatever I'm writing.

I might point out that technically speaking, stenography is also providing a speed bottleneck here, just a less severe one: people can steno a lot closer to thought speeds than they can type, but the delay is still there. This critique also presupposes that you know the next word you want to type -- that is, that the time you spend typing one word will be effectively wasted since you have already selected what the next word will be. I find this to be the case most of the time, but it is hard to put a number on it. There are some times when word selection, connotation, tone, grammar, style, flow, etc. are quite important and additional speed would do me no good because I am actually thinking slower. Also, as will be discussed below, coding is an entirely different story. Since a lot of syntax in programming language is formulaic, it is easy to brief. For example, most programmers I know never actually type "System.out.println()" in Java: they'll use "sysout" with auto completion instead. This might lead one to believe that coding could be greatly helped by steno and shorthand, and to an extent, this is true: once you know what construct you want to use, being able to type it instantly is useful. The thing is, once the projects get large and complex enough, coding requires a lot of abstract thinking, and really fast text-input ceases to be the main speed constraint. I will talk about this more below.

> Steno, by contrast, is quick, clean, and smooth. Many famous writers composed their works in pen shorthand, including Samuel Pepys, Astrid Lindgren (author of the Pippi Longstocking books), and Charles Dickens, whose work as a London court reporter probably had a lot to do with his matchless ear for dialogue.

Even more famous writers composed their works in longhand or on typewriters. While this is interesting historical information, it doesn't have a lot of prescriptive power. For example, speculating that Dickens' talent came from his shorthand experience is too speculative, in my opinion. Why aren't all court reporters accomplished novelists then?

> Every day, between one job and another, I'd haul my gear to the Square Root Cafe and bang out a couple of chapters between bites of grilled cheese sandwich. It wasn't great writing by a long shot, but it flowed in a way that I'd never experienced before. Every word my characters said to me came up on the screen as quickly as they could have spoken them. Before, in the time it took me to type out the six or seven letters that made up each word, my brain would cloud over and I would start second-guessing myself so much it was a mighty battle even to get to the end of a sentence. With steno, most words came in a single stroke, so my text was able to keep ahead of my doubts and excuses and just keep going. I could write for half an hour on the subway going home, or pull out my gear and do a quick 10 minutes in the park before schlepping onward to my next gig. Before, I would have told myself that I didn't have time to get anything substantial done in those few scattered intervals, that I needed several solid hours to get into the flow and mood of writing. After learning steno, I couldn't get away with that ploy. Before I knew it, my 10 minutes were over, but I'd managed to fill half a dozen pages. It wasn't even the speed that helped me do it, primarily; it was the fluency that steno gave to my thinking.

Despite this being anecdata, I am fascinated by the possibility that Mirabai is correct in her evaluation of things here. Something I've tried to gauge in my own tinkering with typing and stenography is how connected they are to thought. Once you really get either a typing layout or steno into muscle memory, neither one is taking up very much conscious brainpower, but they still require a certain degree of background processing to convert sounds into hand movements. It stands to reason that the less hand movements are required, the less brainpower is consumed, and the faster/higher quality the resultant thought. I'd wager that the extent to which this affects any given individual is closely tied to individual and circumstantial factors
