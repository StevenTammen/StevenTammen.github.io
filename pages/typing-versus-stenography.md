## What's Stenography Good For And How Does It Compare?

In a vacuum, machine shorthand (aka stenography, commonly abbreviated "steno") is objectively superior to plain typing in just about every way. The world record for machine shorthand transcription is over 360 WPM. Think about that for a second. *Three hundred and sixty words per minute is mind-blowingly fast*.

If the idea of writing that fast intrigues you, you should read a series of articles -- starting [here](https://stenoknight.com/SpeakFingers.html) -- written by Mirabai Knight, the stenographer behind Plover (a free, open source stenography program). Mirabai argues that there are reasons other than speed for steno (fluency of thought, for example). This is a good series, but strawmans keyboard layouts to an extent. For example, if in your typing you automatically space out punctuation and autocapitalize (just like stenography does), come up with shorthand forms for very common words and phrases (just like stenograpy does), and use a system of prefixes, suffixes, and phrase-enders according to personally-determined patterns (just like stenography does), all of the disparities cited in this series shrink significantly.

In other words, if you start comparing apples-to-apples, while stenography still wins overall since phonetic input will always be faster/more efficient than orthographic input, the differences are not nearly as vast as protrayed here. When I get the time I am going to go through the series point by point and highlight the observations and comparisons that don't apply to properly designed typing setups. (Note: I don't think Mirabai is at all at fault for making the observations and drawing the comparisons -- most people don't use keyboards particularly effectively, so her points stand in the vast majority of cases).

If stenography is simply better in the abstract, even if not by as much as advertised, why shouldn't everybody learn it? Well, the thing is, learning stenography is more than just learning a different character layout. For example, you have to learn:

### The Opportunity Cost: Time Investment

- How to press multiple keys at the same time (known as "chording"), sometimes with the same finger.
- How to consciously distinguish phonemes in pronunciation (everyone does this unconsciously, but most people don't have any practice thinking about it, much less translating it into hand positions).
- How to split words into syllabifications to match outlines in a given translation dictionary. (While translation dictionaries usually have outlines for multiple syllabifications, sometimes people will syllabify words in non-standard ways that aren't defined, and will need try other ways).
- How to deal with the word boundary conflicts introduced from phonetic writing (for example, "we walked around the *lighthouse*" vs. "we walked around the *light house*").
- How to deal with homophones (by, buy, bye; there, their, they're; etc.).
- How to write the full list of words without phonetic outlines (a condition known as "brief solitude"). Most of these are very high frequency words, which is both good and bad -- you'll basically have to learn them all before you can write anything, but you'll learn them fast since you'll need to use them a lot.
- etc.

This isn't even comprehensive. Stenography is an entirely different text-entry paradigm than typing, and for people without any linguistics experience, the majority of the concepts and vocabulary introduced will be things you've never heard of before.

The numbers vary on how long it takes for people to get to high speeds. There are people like [Stanley Sakai](http://stanographer.com/) who got to 225+ WPM in months. The thing is, Stan is also a polyglot (at the time of writing, listing proficiency in English, Korean, Dutch, German, Spanish, American Sign Language, and French on his resume), already knew pen shorthand (Gregg) when he started machine shorthand, and majored in linguistics in college. It took Mirabai a year and half to pass her 225's when studying part-time at a brick-and-mortar steno school. Ted Morin, Plover's current lead Dev, has been practicing stenography for [about 3 years](https://www.facebook.com/morinted/posts/10152184434552401) and is currently around 160 WPM. From my understanding, these people are on the fast end of things. A slightly more pessimistic (though balanced, in my view) take on stenography learning times can be seen [here](http://careyryan.com/stenotype-can-we-type-much-faster/). Also have a look at the [most recent statistics related to the Open Steno Project's Community Survey](http://plover.stenoknight.com/2017/08/responses-to-2017-osp-community-survey.html).

## TODO: frontloaded learning and consistency (stenography) vs. adding "intuitive" efficiency over time (typing)

- [An excellent thread on GeekHack](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=16927.0) where one person's super-efficient typing system comes up in conversation, and Stan Sakai chimes in.

## Who Should Use What

If you are in a field that could benefit from really fast input, there is nothing better than stenography. Such fields might include:

- Transcriptionists (of any type)
- Fields that require frequent "conversational" communication: emails, chatrooms, IRC, etc. Steno shines in conversational contexts because we can easily talk and therefore think at 200+ WPM -- there are no mental speed restrictions in these contexts, so any input method slower than speech will be a speed bottleneck.
- Fields that requires real-time speeds. These would include traditional steno fields like court-reporting, captioning, CART, etc.

For basically everyone else, it's not worth learning stenography from a practical point of view (marginal benefit will never exceed marginal cost). I break here with Mirabai on the idea of writers and programmers learning stenography. Unless the majority of your writing is conversational (as mentioned above) or borders on conversational (such as writing character dialogue in novels), you will never be thinking at 200 WPM since you'll be considering word selection, connotation, tone, grammar, style, flow, etc. I also humbly submit that the idea that programmers think at 200 WPM is preposterous. I am studying computer science full time and am yet to come across someone who could even write pseudocode at anything approaching 200 WPM.

Writers and programmers would of course be able to get their thoughts on screen faster with stenography, theoretically with less disruption to the mental flow of ideas. Here's a good quote from Mirabai's series:

> I'm willing to bet that the act of qwerty typing slows down the thoughts of many people. When I type on a qwerty keyboard, I feel my mind splitting along four consecutive but overlapping tracks: One, the word I want to write. Two, the way it's spelled. I'm a pretty good speller, but English is weird enough that the process is never completely automatic. Three, the series of five to ten finger motions it takes to type it. Four, the error checking mechanism that iterates over the first three and confirms that the correct word choice, orthography, and letter position have appeared onscreen. Usually I'll have already started typing the next word when I spot a spelling or typing error in the previous one, and by the time I've pressed backspace ten times to correct two transposed letters, my train of thought will have gotten all tangled up and I'll have to pause for a second to remember what I was writing. Even when I try to pace myself and type more slowly than usual, I'll make an error like this every few sentences, and my flow of composition will have been interrupted half a dozen times by end of the paragraph. 

I am not aware of any evidence that meets my baseline standard (methodologically-sound, peer-reviewed, double-blind scientific studies conducted by qualified and respected researchers without conflicts of interest and funded by entities without an axe to grind) to either support or refute such speculation. Therefore, I leave judgement up to the reader. I am certain that Mirabai is right to an extent. I just don't think gains here will ever come close to offsetting the time required to learn stenography, especially since typing does not always have to be in the linear sense described here: the more briefs you use, the less typos, generally speaking, you will have, and the gap narrows. Intelligent use of Ctrl + Backspace will also make correction significantly less disruptive, since you just reset your string of thought at the word level (rather than the character level).

## Closing Thoughts

The decision to utilize stenography or ignore it is obviously a personal one. However, the community is super friendly and willing to answer questions. I recommend taking a look at the [Plover Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ploversteno) and [Discord Channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/136953735426473984/136953735426473984) to talk to individuals into steno. I have been involved in both communities for a couple years now, and have stuck around somewhat even after I stopped actively trying to learn stenography. (They even put up with my attempts to [improve the character layout](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ploversteno/-sowdKC_bjU%5B1-25%5D) and [improve stenographic input devices](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ploversteno/aJ6PNMlvLEs)).

One further note here: if you pick up steno as a hobby to have fun and relax, it will pay dividends better than most other hobbies, and it *might* become worth it. The marginal cost/marginal benefit number crunching above presupposes that the only net benefit of steno is increased efficiency in text input.
