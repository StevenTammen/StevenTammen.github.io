## Some propositions to introduce deontology

1. (Absolute morality exists)
2. (Humans are capable of discerning right from wrong)
3. Discerning right from wrong is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right

### Proposition 1

See [argument 1 on this page](https://steventammen.com/life-purpose/#argument-1-absolute-morality-exists). Implicit in this proposition are the existence of two categories called "right" and "wrong," which are central to the rest of the argument.

### Proposition 2

I hold that this proposition is self-evident. Our entire justice system, for example, is based upon the assumption that this is true.

While this proposition does not need to be true 100% of the time for the implication hold below, I personally believe that it is actually true 100% of the time. In my opinion, people know what is right and wrong in their hearts, even if all the world tells them otherwise -- so no person who ran a concentration camp in Germany, for example, could use the "but they told me it was right" excuse to defend their behavior. (Even though their whole higher governmental system told them it was right, they still knew it was wrong).

### Proposition 3

Propositions 3 pressuposes propositions 1 and 2.

We can put this into propositional logic. If d = "I discern right from wrong" and r = "I do right," then this implication reads "r implies d." Here's the truth table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>d</th>
    <th>r → d</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that this implication does not hold if it is possible to do right without discerning right from wrong. As I mentioned above, I don't believe that it is possible for humans to not know right from wrong (which would obviate the need for an explanation here since d would always be true, and thus the implication always true). However, for those that do not believe this, it is still possible to show that the implication holds.

A counterexample someone might use of a person doing right without discerning right from wrong is a business owner paying rent on his warehouse that is owned by the man who runs the local orphanage, thereby supporting local orphans. "Aha!" they say, "the business owner is doing right by supporting local orphans." I submit that the business owner is not inherently doing right because his actions end up supporting the local orphans (a consequence he may not even know about).

Of course, the tricky thing here is that a business owner might actually pay rent on his warehouse in order to suport local orphans (maybe because he grew up an orphan himself he chose a location for a warehouse that would enable him to pay rent that would be used to support an orphanage). This case is different since the business owner's *intention* is right -- he knows about the warehouse owner's orphanage and is acting in support of it. To have right intent, however, he had to know what was right to begin with... meaning he had to discern right from wrong.

In philosophy the contrast introduced above revolves around the difference between [consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) and [deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics). If you are a strict consequentialist then consequences alone determine right and wrong and this implication does not hold. Most people, myself included, are not strict consequentialists.

It's worth pointing out that deontology does not entirely ignore consequences, merely that right and wrong are functions of *intended* consequences rather than *actual* consequences. It's also worth pointing out that moral absolutism and deontology are not mutually exclusive if you view right and wrong as a composite of intent and absolute moral law. For example, stealing from one's neighbors to feed one's family is understandable but still wrong, because stealing from innocent people is universally wrong (stealing from innocent people has negative absolute moral value).

I say *negative* absolute moral value above because right is never determined by action alone, and is thus always subject to intent and the constraints of deontology. In other words, there is no such thing as a positive absolute moral value because doing something with positive consequences for unsound reasons is still not right, even though it may not be wrong. For example, giving money ostentatiously to the poor to be praised for one's generosity is not right (but it is not strictly wrong either). Therefore, since giving money to the poor is not universally right regardless of intent, it does not have positive absolute moral value. (A similar argument can be used in other cases to show that positive absolute moral values do not exist).

Put into logical terms we may understand moral action in the following way -- if n = "I do something with a negative absolute moral value," i = "I have right intent," r = "I do right," and w = "I do wrong," then:

1. n implies w

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>n</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>n → w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that the implication allows for a situation in which someone does not do something with a negative absolute moral value but still does something wrong (because of wrong intent).

2. ¬r is not equivalent to w

When we say two propositions are not equivalent, what we are really saying is that the two propositions are not necessary and sufficient for each other in all cases -- or, to speak in terms of propositonal logic, that the logical biconditional of two propositions is not always true (i.e., a tautology). (If p and q are propositions, biconditionality is defined as (p → q) ∧ (q → p)). 

In this case something being "not right" is not a necessary and sufficient condition for being "wrong" in all cases, demonstrated by the false values in the biconditional:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>¬r</th>
    <th>¬r ↔ w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that a similar argument can be used to show that ¬w is not equivalent to r.

3. r is equivalent to ¬n and i

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>n</th>
    <th>i</th>
    <th>¬n</th>
    <th>¬n ∧ i</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that the *only* way to do right is to not do something with negative absolute moral value and to do something with right intent.

Above I dealt with the objection of someone without right intent (i.e., someone who did not discern right from wrong) doing something that ended up having positive consequences (the business owner supporting the local orphans). Now that we have dealt with some more of the philosophy behind right and wrong, it is possible to see why such an objection is raised: by failing to recognize the possibility of action that is neither morally right nor morally wrong, they come to the conclusion that discerning right from wrong is not a necessary condition to doing right.

The flaw in this logic is that it implicitly presupposes that decisions without intent are moral decisions in the first place -- it substitutes strict consequentialism for deontology for all decisions that result in positive consequences. Now, this is well and good if one actually holds to strict consequentialism, but if you purport to hold to deontology (at least in general), you can not up and decide that intent is not necessary for moral decision-making.

Brushing one's teeth for example, is not a moral decision in and of itself. But brushing one's teeth for the purpose of saving money in the long term (by avoiding expensive dental care) so that you can have more resources to dedicate to your family is a moral decision that is right.
