## Basic Design Methodology

1. Compare letterforms from various writing styles:
  - Regular print
  - D’Nealian Cursive (“regular cursive”)
  - Spencerian
  - Copperplate
2. Evaluate forms based on
  a) Travel distance (“ink consumed”)
  b) Number of distinct direction changes (corners/180 degree turns/“direction-changing loops” rather than wide loops)
  c) Ending position at bottom
  d) Distinguishability from other letters/letter combinations
  e) Broad detail vs. fine detail (broad detail is better for faster speeds/enables faster speeds)
3. Pick the best form
4. For forms where either a connected print form or a cursive form can be improved through a redesign, do so. Make sure that the new form is easily identifiable as the letter it represents.


## TODO

- Slant? Italic forms? Letter/word Spacing? Dotting/crossing timing and execution?
- Add scans
