## Introduction

I've never been a terribly big fan of these sorts of pages. Mostly what seems to end up happening is website authors linking to some rubbish and getting kickbacks from affiliate links. (Or, less nefariously, linking to friends content, or content that only fits their narrow worldviews).

With this being said, I am very much in favor of reading multiple people's views, and believe that cultivated reading lists are a decidedly good thing when done well. We live in an age of information overload -- it can be difficult to cut through the vast swathes of useless and/or manipulative writings to find productive things to read. Starting with someone else's list of "greatest hits" is a good way to efficiently jumpstart productive reading.

Now, I certainly don't pretend to be particularly qualified as a recommender. But that's not the point. In my opinion, everyone who has a website is qualified to give a list of sources that they have found to be valuable, and leave it to others to determine how much weight their recommendation holds. In other words, I make decisions of whose opinions and writings to value every day, based upon such metrics as intelligence, character, objectivity and so forth. I would expect nothing less of anyone else -- even with regards to myself.

## How This Page Is Structured

Rather than simply dump a big list of sources upon you, I have broken things out by category. Each section has a brief introduction that seeks to explain the main idea and practical applicability of the content contained theirein, and I have done the same thing for each book. While I would not impose a hard order on reading things, I would suggest reading things by category. That is, rather than skipping around all the time, it might be more valuable to focus on one overarching topic at a time. I would also suggest starting with the category titled "Escaping The Cave" if you are not familiar with such things as media bias, the influence of public relations and marketing on percepton and consumption, and so forth.

## Escaping The Cave

This category's title is a reference to [Plato's Allegory of the Cave](http://historyguide.org/intellect/allegory.html). I would encourage you to read that link before continuing on. (Alternatively, one may watch the "red pill blue pill" section of *The Matrix*, which is essentially Plato's Allegory of the Cave with with robots and guns).

Many of the readings in this category were introduced to me through a philosophy class that I took during my time at Georgia Tech called PHIL 3127: Science, Technology, and Human Values -- although I have added some things and removed others. I jokingly referred to this class as "Cynicism 101," since almost everything we read made us more distrustful of someone or other. The class had a big impact on me at the time, and has turned out to be one of the most useful classes I've taken in my long college run.

**Category Main Idea:** An illusion exists around us, set up and maintained by people with intent. However, all is not lost. We can detect the illusion around us, come to understand it, and eventually break free from it.

**Category Practical Applicability:** Seeing the world as it really is is important for making good decisions and living a life free from manipulation and irrationality.

### [*Manufacturing Consent*](https://www.amazon.com/Manufacturing-Consent-Political-Economy-Media/dp/0375714499)

Book Main Idea: Rather than being unbiased and objective, committed to a search for truth, the media's real purpose is defending the economic, social, and political agendas of the powerful people who control and finance it.

Book Practical Applicability: Learning about the overall bias of the news, and the individual mechanics in particular, makes one (mostly) immune to the social engineering and overt manipulation that occurs through this medium.

### [*Toxic Sludge is Good For You: Lies, Damn Lies and the Public Relations Industry*](https://www.amazon.com/Toxic-Sludge-Good-You-Relations/dp/1567510604)

Book Main Idea: Much of the consumer and political world is shaped by people who distort truth, sometimes lying blatantly, and other times leaving out enough information and/or spinning inconvenient truths in such a way that it amounts to the same.

Book Practical Applicability: This book serves as one of the most concise introductions to why you shouldn't ever trust people with ulterior motives, no matter how convincing they sound. Because most people in the world really are out to manipulate you for their own benefit, it is essential to have a good understanding of how they will go about doing it so that you can be prepared.

### [*Affluenza: How Overconsumption Is Killing Us -- and How to Fight Back*](https://www.amazon.com/Affluenza-Overconsumption-Killing-Us-Fight/dp/1609949277)

Book Main Idea: Consumerism is a plague that has infected America, distorting our values and judgements, and leading to debt, anxiety, and a constant pursuit of more. Corporations actively seek to propogate this disease, to the detriment of consumers.

Book Practical Applicability: Stepping off of the consumerism treadmill frees one from the corporate rat-race and rampant materialism. Learning about how this disease came about and spread is valuable in learning how to combat it in one's own life.

### [*Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong*](https://www.amazon.com/Lies-My-Teacher-Told-Everything/dp/0743296281)

Book Main Idea: There is systematic distortion in what children are taught in the history classes of American schools. Certain textbooks, some worse than others, present a view of America not concordant with historical fact.

Book Practical Applicability: Appeals to national pride and superiority are quite common in political manipulation. One of history's greatest benefits is giving one a nuanced view of past events such that one does not blindly trust parties (like the government) that seek to present themselves in a better light than their past actions allow for. It follows that having an unbiased (or at least significantly less biased) view of history is important, and this book is a good starting place for acquiring such a view, particularly if one went through public education.

## Understanding The Fallibility of Human Reason

One of the most important things to do after questioning what people are telling you (see "Escaping The Cave") is to question your own beliefs. We all like to think of ourselves as rational, competent thinkers. The truth is that humans are irredeemably irrational in many ways, incapable of viewing reality as it really is.

**Category Main Idea:** As humans, we are biased and irrational in many ways, with a large proportion of these being outside of most people's awareness. Consequently, many people are far more sure of themselves and their beliefs than they should be.

**Category Practical Applicability:** Learning how to examine your own biases and irrational beliefs is at the heart of not only empathy, or the ability to put yourself in others' shoes, but also good decisionmaking.

### [Plato's *Apology of Socrates*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1656)

Book Main Idea: On trial for supposedly corrupting the morals of the youth (among other things), Socrates defends himself by explaining how his quest to prove the Oracle of Delphi wrong in its assessment of him as the wisest man led to him questioning various experts who thought that they had knowledge, only to find out that they had no idea what they were talking about.

Book Practical Applicability: A classic work, Plato's *Apology of Socrates* gives one of the West's most powerful thinker's views on the arrogance of human knowledge. (How much of this is Socrates and how much is Plato is ultimately irrelevant: the so-called ["Socratic question"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_problem) in no way dimishes the applicability of the arguments in this text). The *Apology* is useful mostly as an introduction to the idea that most of what people think they know breaks down under intense questioning.

### [*How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Know-What-Isnt-Fallibility/dp/0029117062)

Book Main Idea: In a rapidly changing world, the biases and stereotypes that help us process an overload of complex information inevitably distort what we would like to believe is reality.

Book Practical Applicability: Bias and irrationality lead to poor decisionmaking and overcondifence. Becoming aware of ones own biases and irrational beliefs is more than half the battle to overcoming them.

### [*Mistakes Were Made (but Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts*](https://www.amazon.com/Mistakes-Were-Made-but-Not/dp/0544574788/)

Book Main Idea: Self-justification and rationalization are more powerful than most people can imagine, and occur with frightening regularity.

Book Practical Applicability: Like biases and irrationality above, learning about self-justification and rationalization is unquestionably the first step to overcoming them. This book also helps make one a bit less unforgiving with respect to attributing motives to others: people may be selfish and manipulative, but they typically don't start out intending to be that way.
