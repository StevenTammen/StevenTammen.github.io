## Best Option

[Perry Ellis Vest](http://www.ebay.com/itm/122552797379)

Another option: [Vintage Vest](https://www.somelikeitholy.com/lightweight-grey-black-herringbone-four-pocket-waistcoat-p-202.html)

## Vests and Concealed Carry

A vest/jacket allows better concealment of a firearm than a tucked in undershirt + overshirt because a vest/jacket will cover the clips from the tuck holster on the belt, and since a vest/jacket is loose fitting and not pulled against the firearm from being tucked in, the firearm will not print as much. Having a pattern like herringbone will further hide printing lines.

## Why Vests Over Merino?

Merino next to skin for comfort: only material that feels dry due to hydrophobic fiber exterior and hydrophilic interior. Also: good balance between absorbability (avoiding wet garbage bag feeling), breathability, wicking ability, quick drying, UPF, odor resistance, strength/durability, elasticity/stretchability, resistance to fire, and resistance to sparking.

But also want: (better) water resistance, (better) wind resistance, stain resistance, wear resistance.

Better to have the above unconnected to merino (i.e., not merino inner liner and some outer layer): if one clothing component gets damaged, whole thing won’t get ruined. Also allows for inter-layer sliding with pressure due to backpacks straps etc. (rather than fabric on skin, i.e., chafing).

##  Vests vs Jackets

Vest instead of jacket: less material on arms is cooler for year round/inside use, vest allows for more uninhibited arm movement and ability to roll up merino sleeves (compromise: give up vest benefits on arms, but gain year round comfort and more free motion). Unlike pants where wear resistance is useful for the full length, wear resistance on the top half of the body is only useful in a few areas: notably, areas that come into contact with surfaces when lying, sitting, or leaning on things, areas that come into contact with straps, and areas exposed to environmental sources of wear like thorns/brambles (hiking), rocks (climbing), etc.

  <table>
   <tr>
    <th>Source of Abrasion</th>
    <th>Area Needing Coverage</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Lying, sitting, and leaning</td>
    <td>Back</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Straps</td>
    <td>Shoulders, sternum, waist</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Environmental</td>
    <td>Whole torso</td>
   </tr>
  </table>

None of these sources of wear really demand arm coverage. Environmental sources of wear are generally avoidable in the arm area: while you often can’t avoid brambles or branches in the leg and torso areas, you can usually move your arms out of the way (by raising them, for example). When climbing, the front of your torso is generally in contact with the rock face, not your arms. There are some circumstances where these observations do not hold true, but they hold true most of the time, particularly in the sorts of circumstances that arise in the urban jungle (instead of the backcountry, e.g.).

Of course, full body abrasion protection is helpful in events such as crashing a bike at 15 miles per hour or tripping headlong over a rocky incline. The problem is one of statistical incidence: it would be great to have your arms covered under these circumstances, but how often do these things really happen? A part of EDC revolves around being ready for anything, true, but decisions on what to carry and wear need to be based in statistical probability. For example, a compass, a ferro rod, and a signalling mirror are good gear choices anytime you go hiking away from civilization, but it doesn’t make sense to carry them everyday because you’ll never have occasion to use them — even during disasters in an urban area. So too here with wear resistant sleeves. The benefits from not having them (less restricted movement, cooler arms/armpits) far outweigh the benefits from having them, because it is improbable in daily life that they would actually come in useful.

## Vests and Weather

Want a lightweight material: can add more layers in winter, but can’t take more off in summer. Adding water and wind resistance extends temperature range lower as well, without really compromising warm weather performance:

Goal: allow vest to be comfortable and useful across the widest range of temperatures.

## Other Considerations

Best if vest has long-ish drape (to make sure water resistance overlaps with pants and to ensure better concealment of firearm) and a high-ish collar (to prevent water from soaking the merino shirt over the top of the vest). Not too high though: too high = no breathability. Want vest to be relatively loose fitting: better air circulation, hides concealed firearm better. Want a dark color to help avoid printing: gray/black conceals stains the best because no fully contrasting colors. Polygiene interior treatment: permanent odor reduction that doesn’t affect moisture handling capabilities like ZnO.

- Stains and sleeves?
- Zip off sleeves vs using Black Diamond Jacket over short sleeve vest in winter?
