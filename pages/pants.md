## Current pick




## Basic Idea

To have normal looking slacks that can be worn up to formal business casual made out of technical fabric with performance characteristics: DWR, quick drying, breathable, 4-way stretch, wicking, etc.

## Always wearing pants

## Initial Question
Are there any pants with 6 easily usable pockets up front and sufficient zipper closure to prevent items falling out and theft?

## Dual front pockets
- Most natural arm position for getting into pockets when standing
- As long as they aren’t too tight/stuffed too full can still easily get into them when sitting
   - Trade off for convenience of getting into them in all other situations
Don’t want to crowd gear too much… have all the leg space, make pockets to spread things out more. ⇒ Only dual front pockets with cargo pockets lower on the leg, not tripled up front pockets and front pockets with a bunch of “sub-pockets” that are difficult to get into. (Cargo pockets should be significantly lower not in the same general area to minimize item overlap).

## Zipper closure
- More secure than velcro or deep pockets alone, also quieter and less obvious to other people (like those wishing to steal things) than velcro closures 
- Helps prevents pickpocketing and things falling out

## Non-zipper front slant pockets
- No zipper lines to scratch things, rub arm/hand/watch when fishing in pocket, or break over time with use.
- Can move items into zippered pockets when needed: convenience/comfort 95%+ of the time trumps the 5% or less when you actually need full zipper closure. (notepad and pen case can double up with items since they won’t scratch them).
- Should have the fewest number of zipper pockets that comfortably allow you to have all items under zipper protection when the need arises. Highest frequency use pockets should be the one(s) without zippers.

## Zipper up/down placement
- Side cargo pockets will be worn closed most of the time ⇒ want to make them easiest to open quickly if need arises ⇒ zipper on top when closed
- As long as this does not make the zipper more likely to come unzipped. For quality zippers, it shouldn’t matter.
- Second slant pockets will be worn open most of the time ⇒ want to make them easiest to close quickly if need arises ⇒ zipper on top when open
- Zipping down universally easier than zipping up

## Cargo pockets on side of leg rather than front
- Almost never have forces on side of legs (unless you are laying on your side), but front cargo pockets can interfere if you ever need to put anything on your lap when sitting, or if desks/tables are short and put pressure on the tops of your legs.
- Depending on how much give front-side cargo pockets have, their contents can put pressure on your leg when pants are pulled tight in a sitting position. Avoided with side pockets.
- Side cargo pockets are easier to get into  than front cargo pockets when sitting.

## Cargo pockets extending down towards knee
- Allows for much larger pocket, more space. Also lets slant pockets be deeper without overlapping ⇒ net space created larger than immediately apparent.
- Has side-effect of items hitting knee area under certain circumstances (which could vary in severity from minor irritation to actually being painful depending on what you are putting in the pockets). Not running/making large, fast movements will reduce severity of problems this causes.
- Tradeoff will depend on your use case and what you are planning on putting in there. In my opinion, the large amount of extra space created is worth it unless your situation’s parameters mare this pocket configuration unworkable. Also depends on Pants model.

## Belt loops
- As long as they are stitched well, thinner loops make it easier to clip stuff onto them and put belts on without sacrificing much durability/load bearing capacity
- Should be able to accommodate larger belts (at least 1.75”), which are more useful overall for load bearing activities (less pressure due to greater surface area to distribute force; wider nylon and beefier cobra buckles can take heavier weights). Specifically SOE Cobra Riggers Belt.
- Loops should strike a happy medium between being too loose (belt not held close to the waistline; floppy) and too tight (can’t clip any things onto belt loops or double up belt).
- Should be a reasonable amount of space between front belt loops to accommodate riggers belts comfortably. Should be able to hold overlap on normal buckle belts.

## Closure system
- Hard metal objects (like the backs of buttons) digging into your skin are bad. Maximizing the surface area of hard objects on the back of the front will help distribute load better. Better not, not having them in the first place.
- Buttons can fall off if thread fails, hook clasps and snaps can’t
- Snaps are faster than buttons or hook clasps to undo when going to the bathroom and getting the pants on and off.
   - But they may be less secure if poorly designed. Under loads, I’m not sure closure system will really matter: they’ll all fail in some way under heavy load, it’s just a matter of when and with how little applied force
- As long as they don’t interfere with day-to-day use, add bulk, etc., having multiple closure systems is a good thing not a bad thing. You can always not use them most of the time, but have the option of double or triple securing your pants if you want the extra reassurance.

## Waistband
- Expandable to allow for carrying things inside the waistband, ease of movement, etc.
- Also doubles as useful feature to accommodate future weight gain, if necessary
- But not tight during normal wearing: only want tension when it’s needed to dynamically change circumference, not during everyday use

## Zipper
- Locking zipper
- Self repairing (if mechanism actually works)
- waterproof
- YKK or high quality
