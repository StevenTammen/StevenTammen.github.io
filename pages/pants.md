## Current pick

- [Outerboro Staple Pants](https://www.outerboro.cc/collections/mens-bottoms/products/staple-pants)

## Basic Idea

To have normal looking slacks that can be worn up to formal business casual made out of technical fabric with performance characteristics: DWR, quick drying, breathable, 4-way stretch, wicking, etc.

## Always wearing pants

- Long pants provide abrasion resistance, relative waterproofness, and sun protection to the legs. Having abrasion resistance on the full length of the legs is useful (rather than just the top). Long pants also help protect against bugs and wind.

## Pockets

- Pants without pockets are silly. Pockets come in useful for carrying things around day-to-day and also for storing things temporarily if you need too.
- The question then is how many pockets. Guy's pants run the gamut from the typical 4 pockets all the way to 16 or more, while ladies' pants have less of a range.
- Relevant pocket factors
   - Total number of pockets (common cofiguations: 2 front slash/2 back, 2 front slash/2 back/2 cargo, 2 front slash/2 back/2 side seam). Some people argue for having extra pockets even if you won't use them most of the time ("just in case"), but I personally avoid them because they add uneccessary material and stiching/seams, making the pants warmer in the summer, less durable overall, and more expensive. I do not commonly find myself needing tons of free pockets (vs. just sticking loose paper or whatever in a pocket with my keys or phone).
   - Can easily get into while sitting
   - Big enough for intended items. In general bigger is better (within reason) since it adds versatility.
   - Not abrasive/uncomfortable to get into (such as having pointy metal zipper tracks)
   - Quick to get into (not too tight, no fiddly bits to mess with to get pocket open)
   - Ability to be sealed (often conflicts with above two). Velcro, zippers, etc.
   - Positoned in such a way that they do not overlap. Overlapping pockets (such as dual front slash pockets) are difficult to distinguish from each other, and can cause uncomfortable bulk if items happen to land in the same place.
   - Do not inhibit free movement/the strecth of the pants
   - Subpockets vs. no subpockets (I think they take to long to get into/are too fiddly, but they can make things more comfortable by letting you store items in a more distributed way. Personal call).
   - Reinforced pocket edges for clipping things like knives and lights
   - Abrasion resistant nylon interiors
   - Upward facing pocket openings (allows storage of objects larger than pockets, kept in by forces of gravity)
- My personal pick is 5 pockets: 2 unzippered front slash pockets, 1 hidden zippered security pocket in the right front slash pocket (for storing phone/passport when travelling), 1 zippered back pocket (on the right), and one unzippered back pocket.
   - Assuming you minimize your cash/cards when you travel, you can use a phone wallet (like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/CardNinja-Ultra-slim-Adhesive-Credit-Smartphones/dp/B009ZVL7N4/) and get away with only one security pocket (for phone/cards/cash and passport). While I normally carry quite a bit more, in high-pickpocket areas, I'll drop most of of my carry and go down to just bare essentials on my keychain (which has keys, an encrypted flashdrive, a Yubikey, a Leatherman Squirt PS4, an Olight i3E, Gorilla tape, and a sealing canister with emergency cash and Caffiene/L-Theanine pills) and a cheap cotton bandana in my back right pocket. The reason why the key getup doesn't need another security pocket is because I attach it to a belt loop with a locking carabiner and kevlar cord (meaning pickpockets can't easily lift it). The carabiner and kevlar cord fill out the rest of my essential carry.
   - This 5 pocket configuration also provides enough zipper pockets to completely secure my pants carry (in the sense of things not falling out or getting lost): wallet/bandana in back right zipper pocket, phone in hidden zippered pocket, and keys clipped to beltloop as described above. A folding knife and full size flashlight can be clipped to the pockets securely without additional zippers. Having the rest of the pockets without zippers leads to more comfortable access and reduced cost.
- Some people might be able to make use of cargo pockets. However, I advocate wearing a vest with pockets instead since it inhibits movement less (the contents of cargo pockets are often uncomfortable when squatting or doing other movements that require lots of knee rotation; pockets are most comfortable when their weight is at the waist level) and lets you access things in a sitting position easier. A 4-pocket vest plus shirt with a right chest pocket gives you another 5 pockets, bringing regular use pockets up to 9 (all except the hidden security pocket), and pickpocket resistant pockets up to 2 (the shirt pocket under the vest is moderately protected; this is where I keep sunglasses in high-pickpocket areas when I'm not wearing them). I've thought a lot about making my EDC completely comprehensive, and my [whole carry](https://steventammen.com/every-day-carry/) fits in the 9 regular use pockets -- so in my opinion, cargo pockets aren't necessary for EDC. They're good for people who need to carry around extra gun mags (LEO's, soldiers, people shooting at the range), but just aren't that useful for the rest of us.

## Zippers
- For pocket closure, more secure than velcro, snaps/buttons, or deep pockets alone. Also quieter than velcro and snaps, and much less fiddly than buttons. Best mechanism for preventing things from falling out.
- Zippers on pockets and pants zipper should be large and easy to grasp
- Should be self-repairing
- Metal or plastic; doesn't matter as long as they are durable. Metal has slight edge for durability.
- Locking zipper mechanism
- YKK zippers are preferable

## Non-zipper Closures
- No zipper lines to scratch things, rub arm/hand/watch when fishing in pocket, or break over time with use.
- Can move items into zippered pockets when needed: convenience/comfort 95%+ of the time trumps the 5% or less when you actually need full zipper closure. (notepad and pen case can double up with items since they won’t scratch them).
- Should have the fewest number of zipper pockets that comfortably allow you to have all items under zipper protection when the need arises. Highest frequency use pockets should be the one(s) without zippers, taking into account hand dominance (i.e., back right pocket vs. front right pocket, even if back left pocket is used less frequently).

## Belt loops
- As long as they are stitched well, thinner loops make it easier to clip stuff onto them and put belts on without sacrificing much durability/load bearing capacity
- Should be able to accommodate larger belts (at least 1.75”), which are more useful overall for load bearing activities (less pressure due to greater surface area to distribute force; wider nylon and beefier cobra buckles can take heavier weights). Specifically SOE Cobra Riggers Belt.
- Loops should strike a happy medium between being too loose (belt not held close to the waistline; floppy) and too tight (can’t clip any things onto belt loops or double up belt).
- Should be a reasonable amount of space between front belt loops to accommodate riggers belts comfortably. Should be able to hold overlap on normal buckle belts.

## Closure system
- Hard metal objects (like the backs of buttons) digging into your skin are bad. Maximizing the surface area of hard objects on the back of the front will help distribute load better. Better not, not having them in the first place.
- Buttons can fall off if thread fails, hook clasps and snaps can’t
- Snaps are faster than buttons or hook clasps to undo when going to the bathroom and getting the pants on and off.
   - But they may be less secure if poorly designed. Under loads, I’m not sure closure system will really matter: they’ll all fail in some way under heavy load, it’s just a matter of when and with how little applied force
- As long as they don’t interfere with day-to-day use, add bulk, etc., having multiple closure systems is a good thing not a bad thing. You can always not use them most of the time, but have the option of double or triple securing your pants if you want the extra reassurance.

## Waistband
- Expandable to allow for carrying things inside the waistband, ease of movement, etc.
- Also doubles as useful feature to accommodate future weight gain, if necessary
- But not tight during normal wearing: only want tension when it’s needed to dynamically change circumference, not during everyday use
