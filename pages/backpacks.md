## Difference between waterproofing for bag and for clothing

- Bag: want it all the time. Might be exposed to situations where there is water apart from rain: spilling drinks, kayaking, etc. Don’t want electronics and papers getting wet. Also possibility of very rapid onset of heavy rain: if you have to fiddle with something to get waterproofing, it could be too late.
  - Therefore, pack covers are out
- Clothing: don’t need it when it’s not raining, extra unnecessary material

## TODO

- Explain superiority of [Ortlieb Flight 27](http://www.bikeforums.net/singlespeed-fixed-gear/299121-ortlieb-flight-27-backpack-review.html) (now discontinued)
