## Current Pick

- [Ortlieb Flight 27](http://www.bikeforums.net/singlespeed-fixed-gear/299121-ortlieb-flight-27-backpack-review.html) (now discontinued)

## Difference between waterproofing for bag and for clothing

- Bag: want it all the time. Might be exposed to situations where there is water apart from rain: spilling drinks, kayaking, etc. Don’t want electronics and papers getting wet. Also possibility of very rapid onset of heavy rain: if you have to fiddle with something to get waterproofing, it could be too late.
  - Therefore, pack covers are out
- Clothing: don’t need it when it’s not raining, extra unnecessary material

## TODO

- Expand upon variables:
   - Mesh back
   - Frame system to keep bag off back (sweating considerations)
   - System to prevent rounding out
   - Dynamic straps (Aarn Packs)
   - Front balance bags (for hiking packs)
   - Padded chest straps
   - Padded waist straps (be able to tuck away)
   - Clips etc. for strap management (so they don't flap around)
   - Hydration bladder option
   - Fully waterproof (submersible): high frequency welded seams, TPU coating, waterproof zippers
   - Fully dustproof
   - Abrasion resistant
   - Retroreflective panels
   - External watter bottle holders
   - External zipper pockets
   - Slight degree of internal organization
   - Aerodynamic
   - Zipper closure (rather than roll-top): allows for further opening of pack and easier access
   - Light colored interior: makes finding things easier
   - Low weight
   - Classy enough to be worn with suit
   - Easy to clean
   - Durable
   - Carrying handle
   - Hooks to hang things (though not too many)
