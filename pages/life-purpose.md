## Outline

The arguments on this page are arranged in the following order:

1. Objective morality exists
2. Doing right is a source of legitimate purpose in life
3. Individual life purpose exists
4. Individual life purpose is knowable

## Argument 1: Objective morality exists

Strict materialists often argue that existence is actually futile and that the meaningfulness of life is a charade that we keep up to numb ourselves to the coldness of reality. Under such a supposition, morality is seen through a subjective lens, a human construct propogated by the weak to keep the strong from ruling them absolutely. There is no right and wrong because the universe is governed by uncaring natural laws and humans humans are merely strings of predictable biological cause and effect drifting to and fro by chance.

I will argue in no uncertain terms that this particular position (i.e., a rejection of objective morality) is incorrect. This does not *ipso facto* disprove strict materialism, but it does demand an explanation for why objective morality exists. (In other words, strict materialism is not inherently incompatible with objective morality, but the latter does not obviously flow from the former, and thus its origin must be exlained). The interaction between strict materialism and objective morality is ultimately a separate issue from whether or not objective morality exists in the first place.

The argument:

1. If objective morality does not exist, then no actions are worse than any other actions.
2. Some actions are worse than other actions.
3. Therefore, objective morality exists.

### Propositon 1

In propositional logic, the first proposition is what is known as an *implication*. If we let a = "objective morality exists" and w = "some actions are worse than other actions," then proposition 1 can be written out formally as "¬a implies ¬w" or "¬w is necessary for ¬a." Here is the truth table for this particular implication:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>a</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>¬a</th>
    <th>¬w</th>
    <th>¬a → ¬w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

If the implication holds, then any time ¬a is true, ¬w must also be true (hence why say that ¬w is *necessary* for ¬a). To argue that the implication does not hold would require some basis other than morality for evaluating things as "better" and "worse." In fact, many philosophers have attempted over the years to convince us that behavior can be classified as better or worse using ethics without any moral judgements of right or wrong being necessary (for example, actions that maximize the pleasure and minimize the pain of the most people are "better"). By engaging in a healthy amount of sophistry and redirection, sometimes it appears that there are no moral underpinnings to such arguments. However, morality is inescapable. Why should pleasure be maximized instead of pain? Is it not because maximizing pain for the most people is "wrong" while maximizing pleasure for the most people is "right"?

### Proposition 2

Proposition 2 can be shown to be true using a simple [*reductio ad absurdum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) argument:

1. If no actions are worse than any other actions, then [insert terrible action] is no worse than saving starving children.
2. Therefore, some actions are worse than other actions.

Here's some examples to put in the [insert terrible action] slot:

* Torturing puppies
* Killing people simply because they are different than you (in race, ethnicity, etc.)
* Raping and murdering pregnant women
* etc.

If you seriously want to argue that torturing puppies is no worse than saving starving children that is your perogative. The conclusion for this *reductio ad absurdum* is necessary for the rest of the arguments on this page, so you can go ahead and ignore my conclusions if you like.

Perhaps you think that my response to such atrocities is simply a product of cultural indoctrination from childhood (etc.). I might suggest that you have never been inside my head: the way that murdered children (for example) make me feel -- the way my blood rises, the way my fists clench, the way my eyes flash darkly -- this is not a product of artificial emotion implanted by society. It's real.

I can accept that you may not feel the same way (i.e., that this argument relies on a subjective experience and is therefore not logically certain), but that doesn't make me wrong. Just because humans can learn to sear their consciences over time does not mean that they do not exist in the first place.

### Conclusion

The conclusion follows because we have established that a) the implication holds, and that b) w is true (i.e., "some actions are worse than other actions"). If you look at the single row in the truth table for which the implication holds and w is true, ¬a is false, and a is true. In other words, objective morality exists.

## Argument 2: It is possible to have a life purpose

Before the argument for this can really get underway, it is necessary to do some groundwork:

1. Right actions and wrong actions exist if and only if objective morality exists
2. Objective morality exists
3. Therefore, right actions and wrong actions exist

The first proposition is true by definition. The second proposition was proved in argument 1. The conclusion follows [*modus ponens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens). This conclusion is a necessary part of the following argumentation:

1. Discerning right actions from wrong actions is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right
2. Discerning individual circumstances is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right
3. Therefore, discerning right actions from wrong actions *and* discerning individual circumstances is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right
4. It is possible to discern right actions from wrong actions
5. It is possible to discern individual circumstances
6. Therefore it is possible to do right
7. Doing right is a sufficient condition for having a life purpose
8. Therefore, it is possible to have a life purpose

To put this into propositions, if

- d = "I discern right actions from wrong actions"
- c = "I discern individual circumstances"
- r = "I do right"
- l = "I have life purpose"

Then

1. r → d
2. r → c
3. Therefore, r → (d ∧ c)
4. d is not a contradiction (i.e., can be true)
5. c is not a contradiction (i.e., can be true)
6. Therefore, r is not a contraction (i.e., can be true)
7. r → l
8. Therefore, l is not a contradiction (i.e., can be true)

### Proposition 1

We can put this into propositional logic. If d = "I discern right from wrong" and r = "I do right," then this implication reads "r implies d." Here's the truth table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>d</th>
    <th>r → d</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Note that this implication does not hold if it is possible to do right without discerning right from wrong. As I mentioned above, I don't believe that it is possible for humans to not know right from wrong (which would obviate the need for an explanation here since d would always be true, and thus the implication would also always be true). However, for those that do not believe this, it is still possible to show that the implication holds.

A counterexample someone might use of a person doing right without discerning right from wrong is a business owner paying rent on his warehouse that is owned by a man who runs a local orphanage, thereby supporting local orphans. "Aha!" they say, "the business owner is doing right by supporting local orphans." I submit that the business owner is not inherently doing right because his actions end up supporting the local orphans (a consequence he may not even know about).

Of course, the tricky thing here is that a business owner might actually pay rent on his warehouse in order to suport local orphans (maybe because he grew up an orphan himself he chose a warehouse that would enable him to pay rent to a landlord that runs a local orphanage). This case is different since the business owner's *intention* is right -- he knows about the warehouse owner's orphanage and is acting in support of it. To have right intent, however, he had to know what was right to begin with... meaning he had to discern right from wrong.

In philosophy the contrast introduced above revolves around the difference between [consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) and [deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics). If you are a strict consequentialist then consequences alone determine right and wrong and this implication does not hold. Most people, myself included, are not strict consequentialists.

It's worth pointing out that deontology does not entirely ignore consequences, merely that right and wrong are functions of *intended* consequences rather than *actual* consequences. It's also worth pointing out that moral absolutism and deontology are not mutually exclusive if you view right and wrong as a composite of intent and absolute moral law. For example, stealing from one's neighbors to feed one's family is understandable but still wrong, because stealing from innocent people is universally wrong (stealing from innocent people has negative absolute moral value).

I say *negative* absolute moral value above because right is never determined by action alone, and is thus always subject to intent and the constraints of deontology. In other words, there is no such thing as a positive absolute moral value because doing something that would normally be right for unsound reasons is still not right, even though it may not be wrong. For example, giving money ostentatiously to the poor to be praised for one's generosity is not right (but it is not strictly wrong either). Therefore, since giving money to the poor is not universally right regardless of intent, it does not have positive absolute moral value. (A similar argument can be used in other cases to show that positive absolute moral values do not exist).

Put into logical terms we may understand moral action in the following way:

If 

- n = "I do something with a negative absolute moral value" 
- i = "I have right intent" 
- r = "I do right"
- w = "I do wrong"

Then:

#### n implies w

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>n</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>n → w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Note that the implication allows for a situation in which someone does not do something with a negative absolute moral value but still does something wrong (because of wrong intent).

#### ¬r is not equivalent to w

When we say two propositions are not equivalent, what we are really saying is that the two propositions are not necessary and sufficient for each other in all cases -- or, to speak in terms of propositonal logic, that the logical biconditional of two propositions is not always true (i.e., a tautology). (If p and q are propositions, biconditionality is defined as (p → q) ∧ (q → p)). 

In this case something being "not right" is not a necessary and sufficient condition for being "wrong" in all cases, demonstrated by the false values in the biconditional:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>¬r</th>
    <th>¬r ↔ w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Note that a similar argument can be used to show that ¬w is not equivalent to r.

#### r is equivalent to ¬n and i

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>n</th>
    <th>i</th>
    <th>¬n</th>
    <th>¬n ∧ i</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Note that the *only* way to do right is to not do something with negative absolute moral value and to do something with right intent.

Above I dealt with the objection of someone without right intent (i.e., someone who did not discern right from wrong) doing something that ended up having positive consequences (the business owner supporting the local orphans). Now that we have dealt with some more of the philosophy behind right and wrong, it is possible to see why such an objection is raised: by failing to recognize the possibility of action that is neither morally right nor morally wrong due to a lack of intent, people come to the conclusion that discerning right from wrong is not a necessary condition to doing right.

The flaw in this logic is that it implicitly presupposes that decisions without intent are moral decisions in the first place -- it substitutes strict consequentialism for deontology for all decisions that result in positive consequences. Now, this is well and good if one actually holds to strict consequentialism, but if you purport to hold to deontology (at least in general), it is impermissable to arbitrarily decide that intent is not necessary for moral decision-making.

Brushing one's teeth for example, is not a moral decision in and of itself. But brushing one's teeth for the purpose of saving money in the long term (by avoiding expensive dental care) so that you can have more resources to dedicate to your family is a moral decision that is right.







# TODO

If it is possible to do right, then it is possible to having a life purpose (doing right is a sufficient condition for having a life purpose)
Objective morality exists
Therefore, it is possible to do right
Therefore, it is possible to have a life purpose

### Proposition 1

By the definition of objective morality

### Proposition 2



1. If objective morality exists, then doing right is a source of legitimate purpose in life
2. Objective morality exists
3. Therefore, doing right is a source of legitimate purpose in life

### Proposition 1

This implication is true definitionally. "Right" and "wrong" are categories defined through absolute logic 

### Proposition 2

If objective morality exists, it is possible to find purpose in life by studying the laws of objective morality and then [following them with right intent](https://steventammen.com/deontology/) (thereby doing right). It is equally true that if objective morality exists, it is possible to find purpose in life by studying the laws of objective morality and then breaking them intentionally (thereby doing wrong).

Some may question why the first part of the implication is necessary. Why doesn't doing right external to objective morality bring purpose? For example, what about people who work to support their family, but believe that existence is futile? 

Definitionally, right and wrong do not exist without morality of some form. If moral judgements comes from subjective morality -- a man working to support his family because it seems best to him -- then categorization of right and wrong have no static meaning because they depend upon individual 

### Proposition 2

Proved in argument 1.

### Conclusion

This is a form of logical deduction known as [*modus ponens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens).

## Argument 3: Individual life purpose exists

To prove that individual life purpose exists, we first start with an argument of the form "if A implies B, and A is equivalent to C, then C implies B."

1. Doing right is equivalent to having a life purpose
2. Doing right is equivalent to following objective morality with right intent given individual circumstances
3. Therefore, following objective morality with right intent given individual circumstances is equivalent to having a life purpose

Proposition 1 is proved in argument 2, and proposition 2 is proved [here](https://steventammen.com/morality-and-individual-circumstances/).

If we define individual life purpose to be the purpose found from following objective morality with right intent given individual circumstances (i.e., following the normative ethics based upon one's individual circumstances), then the conclusion to the argument above proves that individual life purpose exists.

## Argument 4: Individual life purpose is knowable

Given the above definition for individual life purpose, there are three things that could cause individual life purpose to be unknowable: 

1. If objective morality is unknowable
2. If right intent is unknowable
3. If individual circumstances are unknowable

If one assumes that all of these are knowable (at least most of the time), then individual life purpose will also be knowable (at least most of the time).
