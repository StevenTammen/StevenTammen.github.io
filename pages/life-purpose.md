## Outline

The arguments on this page are arranged in the following order:

1. Objective morality exists
2. It is possible to have a life purpose

## Argument 1: Objective morality exists

Strict materialists often argue that existence is actually futile and that the meaningfulness of life is a charade that we keep up to numb ourselves to the coldness of reality. Under such a supposition, morality is seen through a subjective lens, a human construct propogated by the weak to keep the strong from ruling them absolutely. There is no right and wrong because the universe is governed by uncaring natural laws and humans humans are merely strings of predictable biological cause and effect drifting to and fro by chance.

I will argue in no uncertain terms that this particular position (i.e., a rejection of objective morality) is incorrect. This does not *ipso facto* disprove strict materialism, but it does demand an explanation for why objective morality exists. (In other words, strict materialism is not inherently incompatible with objective morality, but the latter does not obviously flow from the former, and thus its origin must be exlained). The interaction between strict materialism and objective morality is ultimately a separate issue from whether or not objective morality exists in the first place.

The argument:

1. If objective morality does not exist, then no actions are worse than any other actions.
2. Some actions are worse than other actions.
3. Therefore, objective morality exists.

### Propositon 1: If objective morality does not exist, then no actions are worse than any other actions

In propositional logic, the first proposition is what is known as an *implication*. If we let o = "objective morality exists" and w = "some actions are worse than other actions," then proposition 1 can be written out formally as "¬o implies ¬w" or "¬w is necessary for ¬o." Here is the truth table for this particular implication:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>o</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>¬o</th>
    <th>¬w</th>
    <th>¬o → ¬w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

If the implication holds, then any time ¬o is true, ¬w must also be true (hence why say that ¬w is *necessary* for ¬o). To argue that the implication does not hold would require some basis other than morality for evaluating things as "better" and "worse." In fact, many philosophers have attempted over the years to convince us that behavior can be classified as better or worse using ethics without any moral judgements of right or wrong being necessary (for example, actions that maximize the pleasure and minimize the pain of the most people are "better"). By engaging in a healthy amount of sophistry and redirection, sometimes it appears that there are no moral underpinnings to such arguments. However, morality is inescapable. Why should pleasure be maximized instead of pain? Is it not because maximizing pain for the most people is "wrong" while maximizing pleasure for the most people is "right"?

### Proposition 2: Some actions are worse than other actions

Proposition 2 can be shown to be true using a simple [*reductio ad absurdum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) argument:

1. If no actions are worse than any other actions, then [insert terrible action] is no worse than saving starving children.
2. Therefore, some actions are worse than other actions.

Here's some examples to put in the [insert terrible action] slot:

* Torturing puppies
* Killing people simply because they are different than you (in race, ethnicity, etc.)
* Raping and murdering pregnant women
* etc.

If you seriously want to argue that torturing puppies is no worse than saving starving children that is your perogative. The conclusion for this *reductio ad absurdum* is necessary for the rest of the arguments on this page, so you can go ahead and ignore my conclusions if you like.

Perhaps you think that my response to such atrocities is simply a product of cultural indoctrination from childhood (etc.). I might suggest that you have never been inside my head: the way that murdered children (for example) make me feel -- the way my blood rises, the way my fists clench, the way my eyes flash darkly -- this is not a product of artificial emotion implanted by society. It's real.

I can accept that you may not feel the same way (i.e., that this argument relies on a subjective experience and is therefore not logically certain), but that doesn't make me wrong. Just because humans can learn to sear their consciences over time does not mean that they do not exist in the first place.

### Conclusion: Objective morality exists

The conclusion follows because we have established that a) the implication holds, and that b) w is true (i.e., "some actions are worse than other actions"). If you look at the single row in the truth table for which the implication holds and w is true, ¬o is false, and o is true. In other words, objective morality exists.

## Argument 2: It is possible to have a life purpose

Before the argument for this can really get underway, it is necessary to do some groundwork:

1. Right actions and wrong actions exist if and only if objective morality exists
2. Objective morality exists
3. Therefore, right actions and wrong actions exist

The first proposition is true by definition. The second proposition was proved in argument 1. The conclusion follows [*modus ponens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens). This conclusion is a necessary precondtion to the following (main) argument:

1. Discerning right actions from wrong actions is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right
2. Discerning individual circumstances is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right
3. Therefore, discerning right actions from wrong actions *and* discerning individual circumstances is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right
4. It is possible to discern right actions from wrong actions
5. It is possible to discern individual circumstances
6. Therefore it is possible to do right
7. Doing right is a sufficient condition for having a life purpose
8. Therefore, it is possible to have a life purpose

To put this into propositions, if

- d = "I discern right actions from wrong actions"
- c = "I discern individual circumstances"
- r = "I do right"
- l = "I have a life purpose"

Then

1. r → d
2. r → c
3. Therefore, r → (d ∧ c)
4. d is not a contradiction (i.e., can be true)
5. c is not a contradiction (i.e., can be true)
6. Therefore, r is not a contradiction (i.e., can be true)
7. r → l
8. Therefore, l is not a contradiction (i.e., can be true)

### Proposition 1: Discerning right actions from wrong actions is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right

Here's the truth table for this implication:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>d</th>
    <th>r → d</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Note that this implication does not hold if it is possible to do right without discerning right action from wrong action. A counterexample someone might use of a person doing right without discerning right action from wrong action is a business owner paying rent on a warehouse he uses, a warehouse that is owned by a man who runs a local orphanage and puts all his profits into the orphanage. "Aha!" they say, "the business owner is doing right by supporting local orphans." I submit that the business owner is not inherently doing right because his actions end up supporting the local orphans (a consequence he may not even know about).

Of course, the tricky thing here is that a business owner might actually pay rent on his warehouse in order to suport local orphans (maybe because he grew up an orphan himself he chose a warehouse that would enable him to pay rent to a landlord that runs a local orphanage). This case is different since the business owner's *intention* is right -- he knows about the warehouse owner's orphanage and is acting in support of it. To have right intent, however, he had to know what was right to begin with... meaning he had to discern right action from wrong action.

In philosophy the contrast introduced above revolves around the difference between [consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) and [deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics). If you are a strict consequentialist then consequences alone determine right and wrong and this implication does not hold. Most people, myself included, are not strict consequentialists.

It's worth pointing out that deontology does not entirely ignore consequences, merely that right and wrong are functions of *intended* consequences rather than *actual* consequences. It's also worth pointing out that moral absolutism and deontology are not mutually exclusive if you view right and wrong as composites of intent and absolute moral law. (Moral absolutism is distinct from moral objectivism -- moral absolutism holds that some actions have moral value that does not change based upon circumstances and context, while moral objectivism holds that right and wrong are not determined by custom and opinion, but may vary depending on context. All moral absolutists are moral objectivists, but not vice versa.) For example, stealing from one's innocent neighbors to feed one's family is understandable but still wrong, because stealing from innocent people is universally wrong (stealing from innocent people has negative absolute moral value).

I say *negative* absolute moral value above because right is never determined by action alone, and is thus always subject to intent and the constraints of deontology. In other words, there is no such thing as a positive absolute moral value because doing something that would normally be right for unsound reasons is still not right, even though it may not be wrong. For example, giving money ostentatiously to the poor to be praised for one's generosity is not right (but it is not strictly wrong either). Therefore, since giving money to the poor is not universally right regardless of intent, it does not have positive absolute moral value. (A similar argument can be used in other cases to show that positive absolute moral values do not exist).

Put into logical terms, we may understand moral action in the following way:

If 

- n = "I do something with a negative absolute moral value" 
- i = "I have right intent" 
- r = "I do right"
- w = "I do wrong"

Then

#### n implies w

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>n</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>n → w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Note that the implication allows for a situation in which someone does not do something with a negative absolute moral value but still does something wrong (because of wrong intent).

#### ¬r is not equivalent to w

When we say two propositions are not equivalent, what we are really saying is that the two propositions are not necessary and sufficient for each other in all cases -- or, to speak in terms of propositonal logic, that the logical biconditional of two propositions is not always true (i.e., a tautology). (If p and q are propositions, biconditionality is defined as (p → q) ∧ (q → p)). 

In this case something being "not right" is not a necessary and sufficient condition for being "wrong" in all cases, demonstrated by the false values in the biconditional:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>¬r</th>
    <th>¬r ↔ w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Note that a similar argument can be used to show that ¬w is not equivalent to r.

#### r is equivalent to ¬n and i

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>n</th>
    <th>i</th>
    <th>¬n</th>
    <th>¬n ∧ i</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Note that the *only* way to do right is to not do something with negative absolute moral value and to do something with right intent.

Above I dealt with the objection of someone without right intent (i.e., someone who did not discern right action from wrong action) doing something that ended up having positive consequences (the business owner supporting the local orphans). Now that we have dealt with some more of the philosophy behind right and wrong, it is possible to see why such an objection is raised: by failing to recognize the possibility of action that is neither morally right nor morally wrong (due to a lack of intent), people come to the conclusion that discerning right action from wrong action is not a necessary condition to doing right.

The flaw in this logic is that it implicitly presupposes that decisions without intent are moral decisions in the first place -- it substitutes strict consequentialism for deontology for all decisions that result in positive consequences. Now, this is well and good if one actually holds to strict consequentialism, but if you purport to hold to deontology (at least in general), it is impermissible to arbitrarily decide that intent is not necessary for moral decision-making.

Brushing one's teeth for example, is not a moral decision in and of itself. But brushing one's teeth for the purpose of saving money in the long term (by avoiding expensive dental care) so that you can have more resources to dedicate to your family is a moral decision that is right.

### Proposition 2: Discerning individual circumstances is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right

This one one is a bit more straightforward. "Individual circumstances" is meant to taken in the broadest possible sense: individual talents, abilities, and proclivities; available income; free time; familial and/or relational obligations; combat prowess; etc.

A good quote to help explain why this implication holds is from Edmund Burke: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." If an active shooter shows up at the store you work at, *and you have the means to stop him but you don't*, then this is morally wrong. Of course, if you are an eighty-year-old grandmother, not stopping the active shooter is not going to be morally wrong because you did not have the means to stop him (probably). Hence individual cicumstances.

To generalize this more, what is done can not in good wise be separated from the context in which it is done. Giving food to hungry children on the street is right... but not if it means your own children starve to death. Exercising to stay healthy is right... but not if means you ignore your spouse.

The concept extends even further -- doing something that you have no talent for, for example, is not the highest moral good. While this essentially needs a long explanation of its own, the idea is this: among a range of morally right or morally neutral options, some will have greater net benefit than others. This does not make the other options morally wrong (at least not all the time), but it does mean that among a set of possible actions, some choices will be ethically superior to others. What choices are ethically superior will vary depending upon the individual in question. Hence individual circumstances.

### Proposition 3: discerning right actions from wrong actions *and* discerning individual circumstances is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right

That this follows from the prior two propositions is shown using a truth table below, although you could do it the icky way with a proof too. If both d and c are necessary for r, then (d ∧ c) is necessary for r.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>d</th>
    <th>c</th>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>d ∧ c</th>
    <th>r → d</th>
    <th>r → c</th>
    <th>(r → d) ∧ (r → c)</th>
    <th>r → (d ∧ c)</th>

### Proposition 4: It is possible to discern right actions from wrong actions

I hold that this proposition is self-evident. Our entire justice system, for example, is based upon the assumption that this is true.

While this proposition does not need to be true 100% of the time for this argument to work, I personally believe that it is actually true 100% of the time. In my opinion, people know what is right and wrong in their hearts, even if all the world tells them otherwise -- so no person who ran a concentration camp in Germany, for example, could use the "but they told me it was right" excuse to defend their behavior. (Even though their whole higher governmental system told them slaughtering innocent people was right, they still knew it was wrong).

### Proposition 5: It is possible to discern individual circumstances

As with proposition 4, while this proposition does not need to be true 100% of the time for this argument to work, I personally believe that it is actually true 100% of the time --  while I don't believe that it is possible to perfectly discern individual circumstances, I believe that it may be done in all circumstances to the point of no longer having moral weight. In other words, you do not need the exact decimal value of your bank account balance to know whether or not you are capable of helping out a friend in need. Similarly, you do not need to have kept track of exactly how much time you've spent with your family in the last week to know that going in to work on Saturday morning (no matter how urgent your boss makes it sound) is wrong.

### Proposition 6: It is possible to do right

If both d and c *can be* true (that is, they are not contradictions), then r *can be* true as well. See the first row in this truth table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>d</th>
    <th>c</th>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>(d ∧ c)</th>
    <th>r → (d ∧ c)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

The fact that r can be false here too (if d and c are true) makes perfect sense: just because you are capable of discerning right action from wrong action and discerning individual circumstances (thereby figuring out what is right for *you* to do), you are not bound to do right. People know what is right for them to do, yet still choose wrong every day (myself included -- it is part of being an irrational human being).

### Proposition 7: Doing right is a sufficient condition for having a life purpose

I left this intentionally non-exclusive. Some people argue that you can have a life purpose if and only if you do right. The problem with this is that doing wrong is just as valid a life purpose *logically* as doing right, i.e., the existence of objective morality equally supports a life purpose of setting oneself in opposition to morality.

Of course, I don't actually think anyone goes about trying to make their life purpose being immoral, but that does not change the fact that it is another logically permissible life purpose. There is also the possibility that there is something else that gives life purpose aside from following or setting oneself in opposition to objective morality. I leave this determinaton up to the reader. (Personally I do not believe there is -- people's typical declarations of life purpose, such as "helping others," "being the best ____________ that has ever lived," "teaching other people truth," etc. are all simply facets of following objective morality, i.e., doing right).

### Conclusion: It is possible to have a life purpose

See row 1 of the truth table below. Propositon 6 showed that r is not a contradiction, and therefore that it can be true.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>l</th>
    <th>r → l</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Notice that l is not *necessarily* true: if you do not do right (and there is no other legitimate source of life purpose), then you will not have a life purpose. I think it is entirely possible that this explains the general existential torpor of the postmodern West: assuming no other source of life purpose, if you throw out right and wrong (making it definitionally impossible to do right), of course people are going to feel like life is meaningless and futile.
