## Outline

The arguments on this page are arranged in the following order:

1. Objective morality exists
2. It is possible to have a life purpose

## Argument 1: Objective morality exists

Strict materialists often argue that existence is actually futile and that the meaningfulness of life is a charade that we keep up to numb ourselves to the coldness of reality. Under such a supposition, morality is seen through a subjective lens, a human construct propogated by the weak to keep the strong from ruling them absolutely. There is no right and wrong because the universe is governed by uncaring natural laws and humans humans are merely strings of predictable biological cause and effect drifting to and fro by chance.

I will argue in no uncertain terms that this particular position (i.e., a rejection of objective morality) is incorrect. This does not *ipso facto* disprove strict materialism, but it does demand an explanation for why objective morality exists. (In other words, strict materialism is not inherently incompatible with objective morality, but the latter does not obviously flow from the former, and thus its origin must be explained). The interaction between strict materialism and objective morality is ultimately a separate issue from whether or not objective morality exists in the first place.

The argument:

1. If objective morality does not exist, then no actions are worse than any other actions.
2. Some actions are worse than other actions.
3. Therefore, objective morality exists.

### Propositon 1: If objective morality does not exist, then no actions are worse than any other actions

In propositional logic, the first proposition is what is known as an *implication*. If we let o = "objective morality exists" and w = "some actions are worse than other actions," then proposition 1 can be written out formally as "¬o implies ¬w" or "¬w is necessary for ¬o." Here is the truth table for this particular implication:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>o</th>
    <th>w</th>
    <th>¬o</th>
    <th>¬w</th>
    <th>¬o → ¬w</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

If the implication holds, then any time ¬o is true, ¬w must also be true (hence why say that ¬w is *necessary* for ¬o). To argue that the implication does not hold would require some basis other than morality for evaluating things as "better" and "worse." In fact, many philosophers have attempted over the years to convince us that behavior can be classified as better or worse using ethics without any moral judgements of right or wrong being necessary (for example, actions that maximize the pleasure and minimize the pain of the most people are "better"). By engaging in a healthy amount of sophistry and redirection, sometimes it appears that there are no moral underpinnings to such arguments. However, morality is inescapable. Why should pleasure be maximized instead of pain? Is it not because maximizing pain for the most people is "wrong" while maximizing pleasure for the most people is "right"?

### Proposition 2: Some actions are worse than other actions

Proposition 2 can be shown to be true using a simple [*reductio ad absurdum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) argument:

1. If no actions are worse than any other actions, then [insert terrible action] is no worse than saving starving children.
2. Therefore, some actions are worse than other actions.

Here's some examples to put in the [insert terrible action] slot:

* Torturing puppies
* Killing people simply because they are different than you (in race, ethnicity, etc.)
* Raping and murdering pregnant women
* etc.

If you seriously want to argue that torturing puppies is no worse than saving starving children that is your perogative. The conclusion of this *reductio ad absurdum* argument is necessary for the rest of the arguments on this page, so you can go ahead and ignore my conclusions if you like.

Perhaps you think that my response to such atrocities is simply a product of cultural indoctrination from childhood (etc.). I might suggest that you have never been inside my head: the way that murdered children (for example) make me feel -- the way my blood rises, the way my fists clench, the way my eyes flash darkly -- this is not a product of artificial emotion implanted by society. It's real.

I can accept that you may not feel the same way (i.e., that this argument relies on a subjective experience and is therefore not logically certain), but that doesn't make me wrong. Just because humans can learn to sear their consciences over time does not mean that they do not exist in the first place.

### Conclusion: Objective morality exists

The conclusion follows because we have established that a) the implication holds, and that b) w is true (i.e., "some actions are worse than other actions"). If you look at the single row in the truth table for which the implication holds and w is true, ¬o is false, and o is true. In other words, objective morality exists.

## Argument 2: It is possible to have a life purpose

Before the argument for this can really get underway, it is necessary to do some groundwork:

1. Right actions and wrong actions exist if and only if objective morality exists
2. Objective morality exists
3. Therefore, right actions and wrong actions exist

The first proposition is true by definition. The second proposition was proved in argument 1. The conclusion follows [*modus ponens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens). This conclusion is a necessary precondition to the following (main) argument:

1. Knowing right is a necessary but not sufficient condition for having right intent
2. Having right intent is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing right
3. Doing right is a sufficient condition for having a life purpose
5. Given that the above implications hold, it is possible to have a life purpose

To put this into propositions, if

- k = "I know right"
- i = "I have right intent"
- r = "I do right"
- l = "I have a life purpose"

Then

1. i → k
2. r → i
3. r → l
5. (i → k) ∧ (r → i) ∧ (r → l) ∧ l is not a contradiction (i.e., can be true)

To show that a proposition is not a contradiction, all that is necessary is one value that is not false. This can be easily done for the proposition (i → k) ∧ (r → i) ∧ (r → l) ∧ l using a truth table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>k</th>
    <th>i</th>
    <th>r</th>
    <th>l</th>
    <th>i → k</th>
    <th>r → i</th>
    <th>r → l</th>
    <th>(i → k) ∧ (r → i) ∧ (r → l) ∧ l</th>

If this looks scary, don't worry -- we'll break it down. Each of the situations where it is possible to have a life purpose given that the three implications hold is broken down below (along with the propositions themselves). As we shall see, the fact that proposition 3 is r → l (my doing right is a sufficient condition for my having a life purpose) rather than r ↔ l (I have a life purpose if and only if I do right) widens the number of situations where you cn have life purpose, since r → l allows for finding life purpose from thigs other than doing right.

### Proposition 1: Knowing right is a necessary but not sufficient condition for having right intent

This implication (and the following implication) deal with a branch of normative ethics called [deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics), specifically, the idea that the morality of an action depends upon intent as well as the action's actual consequences. This is in opposition to strict [consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) wherein an action is deemed right or wrong only based on the action's actual consequences.
