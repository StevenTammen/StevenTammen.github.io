## Business Formal

Keep suit wool because of traditional expectations or get modern technical features like DWR, breathbility, quick dry, 4-way stretch, etc.?

## TODO

- reason for boots vs Lem’s 9 to 5 dress shoes
- reason for cobra rigger’s belt vs CCW leather
- reason for Crew vs OTC socks (or vice versa?)
- reason for aviator sunglasses shape (vs other flat geometries)
- Even if other people’s evaluations weren’t a factor, would high-visibility shirt/pants/backpack be desirable? Certain colors tire the eyes?
- Color of pants, vest, shirt (printing, shows wetness, heat from sun, hides stains). How baggy should clothing be?
- Color/material underwear? Socks?
- Color: psychological factors (look more intelligent, etc.). Actual science behind this?
- Is there any purpose to shirt collars?
- Tencel Research
   - Surface of tencel hydrophilic or hydrophobic, how this affects feeling against skin
   - Hygroscopic — measure of water absorption (look at Lenzing lit.: does wool absorb more vapor than Tencel?)
