<h1 class="center"> About The Site </h1>

## Author

My name is Steven Tammen and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Georgia studying Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Classical culture. I am also interested in philology, the ancient Near East, and ancient history in general.

My other interests cluster around the theme of practical efficiency -- optimizing objects and processes through systematic study and continuous improvement to make them the best they can be according to the constraints inherent to reality.

## Purpose

This site exists to

- Give me a centralized internet presence
- Give me a platform to spread my thoughts on a wide variety of otherwise unrelated topics
- Contribute to free and open knowledge

This site does not exist to

- "Market myself"
- Make money by locking content behind exclusive mailing lists, paid eBooks, monthly subscriptions, or other things of the sort
- Make money through advertising or affiliate marketing

## Markdown Source

At the top of every page I have included two buttons that link to its [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) source: one links to the page's location in the site's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/StevenTammen/steventammen.github.io) and the other links to the page's location on [Prose.io](http://prose.io/), an online markdown editor for GitHub.

## Continuous Improvement

Although I do my best to provide good content when I first publish a page, I will continue to edit and update pages to improve them over time. That is to say, I view this site as a perpetual "work in progress" rather than a collection of static documents. This constant refinement over time is, in my opinion, essential to long-term quality. Changes to individual pages can be tracked by viewing the commit history of their markdown source in the site's GitHub Repository. I may clean out the commit history every once in a while if it gets too cluttered, but, for any given page, you'll generally be able to get a pretty good idea of what's happened in the last few commits.

## Open Source Content

You can help improve the site's content by submitting pull requests with editorial changes on Github, or by editing the pages on Prose.io and then pressing "Save" --> "Submit Change Request", which will automatically create the pull request for you. Prose.io is great if you don't have a lot of experience with Git and GitHub -- even though you need a GitHub account to propose changes through Prose.io, you need no other knowledge, so once you [set up a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), you can contribute freely without having to know all the complicated programmer stuff. If you aren't comfortable contributing through GitHub or Prose.io, you can also just email improvements to <a href="mailto:edits@steventammen.com">edits@steventammen.com</a>.

At the present time, I am not aware of any easy way for me to make content editable in a rich text environment, so if you want to contribute through GitHub or Prose.io, you are going to have to learn the basics of [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). You won't have to know anywhere near the whole specification to help -- if you skim the sections related to paragraphs, links, lists, and emphasis and you should have a good working knowledge in just a few minutes.

Example Content Improvements:

- Eliminating typos
- Eliminating unecessary verbosity or denseness of prose
- Improving phrasing, flow, or pacing
- Replacing technical jargon and unecessarily large words with more universally understood synonyms
- Splitting up unecessarily long sentences into forms easier to follow, i.e., simplifying syntax as appropriate
- Adding visual aids, such as diagrams, to enhance comprehension
- Anything else you think could make the content better

## Open Source Design

You can help improve the site itself by submitting pull requests with design improvements. If you are comfortable with web development languages but not GitHub pull requests, you can send implementations to <a href="mailto:design@steventammen.com">design@steventammen.com</a> and I'll incorporate them into the repository myself. If you aren't comfortable with web development languages or GitHub pull requests, your ideas are still valuable, and you can send them to that same address.

Example Design Improvements:

- Improving the desktop UX
- Improving the mobile UX
- Improving accessibility
- Anything else you think could make the site better

For pull requests requiring significant amounts of work, it would be a good idea to check with me early on to make sure I approve of the changes or enhancements being considered. I don't want to put you in a situation where you put a lot of work into something that I wouldn't ultimately use.
