<h1 class="center"> About The Site </h1>

## Author

My name is Steven Tammen and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Georgia studying Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Classical culture. I am also interested in philology, the ancient Near East, and ancient history in general.

My other pursuits cluster around the theme of practical efficiency -- optimizing objects and processes through systematic study and continuous improvement to make them the best they can be according to the constraints inherent to reality.

## Purpose

This site exists to

- Give me a centralized internet presence
- Give me a platform to spread my thoughts on a wide variety of otherwise unrelated topics
- Contribute to free and open knowledge

This site does not exist to

- "Market myself"
- Make money by locking content behind exclusive mailing lists, paid eBooks, monthly subscriptions, or other things of the sort
- Make money through advertising or affiliate marketing

## Backend

Please have a look at the Readme in the [Github repository](https://github.com/StevenTammen/steventammen.github.io) for a concise technical summary of this site's operation.

## Stucture

The [Home page](https://steventammen.com/) of this site gives a brief overview of what has been published recently, and will also host other items as the need arises (requests for help with projects, announcements, etc.). The [Contact page](https://steventammen.com/contact/) and [CV page](https://steventammen.com/CV.pdf) are exactly what they sound like -- there are links to my publications/writings in the CV.

The [Pages page](https://steventammen.com/pages/) contains all the pages that have been completed, organized into alphabetically-sorted categories. If you know what you are looking for, you can use Ctrl+f (or your hotkey equivalent) to rapidly navigate to it. The [In Progress page](https://steventammen.com/in-progress/) is organized in exactly the same manner, but contains pages that are not yet completed. These pages may range from barely started (a collection of research links and bullet points with preliminary thoughts), to almost finished (complete expositions waiting for proofreading and polishing).

The [Search page](https://steventammen.com/search/) contains an embedded Google custom search object. You may search using the same syntax as normal (enclosing things in quotes, prepending things with dashes, etc.), but results will show up on the page rather than in another window, and will be limited to results on this site.

The [Settings page](https://steventammen.com/settings/) will eventually contain various customization options for the site, such as adjusting font size, line spacing, background color, and so forth. Please check back later -- I will try to implement customization as soon as I can.

The [Contribute page](https://steventammen.com/contribution-guidelines/) explains how you can help contribute to this site.

## Publishing In-Progress Pages

I am strong believer in publishing content before it is finished completely. This is so for two reasons: 1) waiting until pages are "finished" before publishing means that they aren't useful to anyone else until the very end of the research and writing process, and 2) I am far from a perfect writer (and my knowledge in many areas is less than complete), so giving other people opportunities to critique my writing from the very beginning of the process will help improve the content more than waiting until some arbitrary point of "good enough for others to see". To use an anology, open source code projects don't wait until their code is "good enough" to push to GitHub, they start open source from the get go, and are better for it. Obviously prose is not code, but the same general logic applies: 

1. Multiple people working on the same thing will yield better results than a single individual
2. This is true at all stages of the creative process, not just for edits of an already-finished work
3. Therefore, enabling multiple people to contribute at all stages of the process will yield optimal quality
4. Optimal quality is a desirable thing that should be pursued
5. Therefore, policies enabling multiple people to contribute at all stages of the process should be pursued

## Open Source

As the chain of propositions above shows, I believe that open source projects will yield the best results, in the long run. Software has been part of the open source movement for a while now, and hardware is beginning to get there (see: crowdsourced tech startups), but, to my knowledge, there has not been much of a push to opensource *websites themselves*. I find this somewhat puzzling, since open projects offer so many advantages and so few disadvantages. I have designed this website to be entirely open source, and the content is licensed under an open source license (see below). Contribution guidelines may be found on the [Contribute page](https://steventammen.com/contribution-guidelines/).

## Continuous Improvement

I view this site as a perpetual "work in progress" rather than a collection of static documents in an immutable framework. This constant refinement over time is, in my opinion, essential to long-term quality. Changes to individual pages can be tracked by viewing the commit history of their markdown source in the site's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/StevenTammen/steventammen.github.io). I may clean out the commit history every once in a while if it gets too cluttered, but, for any given page, you'll generally be able to get a pretty good idea of what's happened in the last few commits.
