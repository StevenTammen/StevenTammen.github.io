## Computer Desktop

- Black saves power with OLED displays: only turn on pixels that are actually being used
- Greatest distinguishability between black background and lighter color foreground windows. (foreground windows will be lighter b/c makes text more legible)
- Worth tradeoff of having picture to remind you of something (e.g., wife, quote, etc.)?
