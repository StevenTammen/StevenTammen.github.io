## Current Pick

- LG Curved OLED 4K TV

## Size and Resolution

- Increased screen size without matching increases in resolution has diminishing returns. While a bigger screen will make reading easier, it also means more required travel for your eyes: your eyes have to move a greater distance to read an equivalent amount of text.
   - For this reason it is probably best to keep 1080p monitors at or under ~27"
- The increased readability enables you to put two windows side by side, which can increase work efficiency significantly.

## Computer Desktop

- Black saves power with OLED displays: only turn on pixels that are actually being used
- Greatest distinguishability between black background and lighter color foreground windows. (foreground windows will be lighter b/c makes text more legible)
- Worth tradeoff of having picture to remind you of something (e.g., wife, quote, etc.)?
