### Preface

I am a Christian -- and by this I mean that I trust in Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. There is much improper application of the label of "Christian", and it is common for people to lump all of us together into one category and draw conclusions as if we were all the same; while a powerful rhetorical strategy, [this is fallacious](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/False_analogy). For example, throughout history, people that claimed the title of "Christian" for themselves tortured Jews and Muslims to death ([The Spanish Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition)), killed each other in the name of God ([The English Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War), among others), and attempted to justify abhorrent behavior using the Bible (such as the enslavement of Native peoples during European colonialism) -- I agree with none of these things, and submit that were the love of Christ truly in these people, they would not have either. My Christianity and their "Christianity" are cut of completely different cloths; just as atheists today are not directly comparable to Mao or Stalin, so too are Christians today not directly comparable to their supposed forebearers. In like manner, perverse behaviors or poor arguments undertaken by today's crop of "Christians" are really of no import in evaluating the veracity of propositions related to true Christianity.

All this is to say that I view myself as fundamentally distinct from "Christianity" as most people conceptualize it -- the organized religion variety that has no basis in scripture. I would be just as happy as most secular humanists to see this manifistation of "Christianity" die out completely.

What do I believe then? I believe that the Bible, in its original texts, is the inerrant word of God, fully sufficient for understanding and navigating life. The Bible (correctly interpreted) is my statement of faith.

### The Age of the Earth

I do not believe that the earth is ~6000 years old; such a position is not defensible given the light reaching our planet from millions of light years away. I am comfortable accepting the current scientific estimate, but would not be troubled if they change their mind up or down as new evidence rolls in. See the discussion of the so-called "Genesis Gap" below.

### Evolution

I believe in organismal adapatation to environmental stressors over time (call this what you will). I do not believe in so-called "molecules to man" evolution:

1. It is impossible to experimentally test its core hypothesis, viz., that life can begin from nothing and turn into humans through the mechanism of natural selection. In much the same way theoretical astrophysics is not testable, evolution is not testable. This doesn't mean that it is not science *per se*, but it does mean that it is categorically different than testable hypotheses, and ought to be treated as such (rather than uncritically accepted).
2. I have never seen any sort of remotely plausible explanation for abiogenesis and the first DNA/RNA self-repliction. (Lightning making amino acid soup does not abiogenesis prove).
3. Uniformitarianism is not a valid presupposition due to overwhelming evidence of mass extinctions.
4. The so-called ["Genesis Gap"](http://ichthys.com/sr2-copy.htm) between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 explains many of evolutionists' critiques of creationism, such as the fossil record and the age of the earth.

### Global Warming

I think it is likely that human pollution has contributed to the earth's rising temperatures, and that it would be good if we made an effort to clean up our energy. I also think that the situation is incredibly complicated (e.g., solar patterns, atmospheric factors, natural climatic variability), and that it is impossible to determine with any sort of accuracy humanity's contribution -- it is absolutely indefensible to say that humans caused global warming because we have no way of eliminating possible lurking variables that could also explain the current trend. (On the other hand, it is equally indefensible to dogmatically state that we *didn't* cause global warming). Researchers should stop making claims they cannot support with data.

### Feminism

I am 110% in favor of women getting equal pay, benefits, etc. for equal work. This should not be a difficult thing to get behind, in my opinion. With this being said, maternity leave is a bit tricky to make fair to all parties; while it is true that it is important for women, it is also a bit unreasonable to expect companies to deal with long absences and accept workers back as if they had missed nothing. I don't think this consideration alone is valid grounds for paying women less, but it is reasonable for companies to discuss ways in which it can be worked around equitably. (Obviously this does not apply for women who are not planning on having children).

I have absolutely no problem with women in leadership, math and science, or other traditionally male-dominated fields. However, I am somewhat troubled by "the mascularization of women" vs. "the empowerment of femininity". What I mean by this is that I have seen a much bigger push to have women do all the things that men do (which are valued in our society) than a push to have them do the things that they excel at (on average), like empathy, caregiving, and child-rearing (which are not valued as much in our society).

Now, I am in no way trying to say that all women are bad at math, for example, or even that all women are more empathetic than men, but simply that we should be mature enough as a society to support people doing what they are good at, even if it isn't conventionally sucessful: our definition of success is part of the problem in female oppression. Women should not be stigmatized for wishing to raise their children or for wishing to care for the elderly. Women should also not be stigmatized for working in industry or having a career. Each individual woman should play to her own strengths, and ignore whatever society says she should be doing if it runs counter to what she knows she should be doing.

### Abortion

I am pro-life. Unlike many Christians, I believe that human life proper begins at birth (when the spirit is given) rather than conception, but this does not in any way make abortion acceptable. Biological life is still life, just not of the fully human variety (which is dichotomous in nature, composed of flesh *and* spirit rather than just flesh).

As to governmental regulation of abortion, this is really the only area that I support Christian involvement in legislating morality -- in my reading of scripture, Christians are not here to impose our moral code upon the world in a general sense. However, in this situation -- wherein innocent life is being ended -- I believe that the correct course of action is for Christians to vote for its prohibition (just as we would attempt to make murder illegal were it not already). Note: this is in no way an encouragement to participate in *politics* -- Christianity and politics proper (with "political causes", "lobbying", etc.) do not mix. Voting one's mind is an individual action that involves no compromise of values, while getting caught up in politics always involves compromise of values. Politics is no game for idealists.

### Homosexuality and Gay Marriage

I personally view *homosexual sex* as a sin, because that is what the Bible has to say on the matter. Homosexual attraction is not a sin, just as heterosexual attraction is not a sin. I think that it is possible that there is a genetic component to homosexual attraction, and am quite convinced that it is uncontrollable for those who experience it.

I think that [civil marriage rights and benefits](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/marriage-rights-benefits-30190.html) should be able to be enjoyed by everyone. In my opinion, these benefits should not only be extended to consenting adults of the same gender that plan to have a sexual relationship, but also to people that do not plan to have any sort of sexual relationship, such as siblings, a parent and a child, platonic friends, etc. I would not have a problem if people wished to call these unions marriage, although I might suggest different terminology so that it wouldn't get confused with the traditional definition of one man and one woman. I also would not have a problem if people were permitted to have multiple relationships of this nature -- although I would again suggest that a word other than "polygamy" be used to describe the situation to avoid polygamy's connotative baggage.

People should not be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual attraction in any context (just like people should never be discriminated against on the basis of their race). If it is uncontrollable, how can you possibly hold someone responsible for it? On the other hand, in situations dealing with religious assembly, I see no problem with people making decisions based on the behavior of practicing homosexuals. Christians treat adulterers differently than others, for example -- not on account of their natures or urges, but on account of their personal choices and past behavior. People ought to be allowed to decide who they want to associate with in the context of their religious assemblies (freedom of religion), and choose not to conduct a religious ceremony for same-sex couples if they feel it violates their beliefs. This in no way gives justification for discrimination in any other sphere, and is not a privelege unique to Christians: I would argue that Muslims have a similar right to refuse to marry Christians in a traditional Muslim ceremony, for example.

### Transgender and Intersex Issues

As a Christian, I do not believe that God puts male spirits in female bodies or vice versa (and therefore disagree in principal with elective sex reassignment surgery and the concept of "gender identity"). I also do not believer that intersex people are "mistakes" in any way, but am not well-enough informed to make judgements about their use of surgery or lack thereof. Their choices are between them and God.

In terms of whether or not it makes sense for there to be any additional bathroom options other than "male", and "female", I would argue in the negative. Consider the example of right handed scissors and left handed scissors. There are many more left handed people than trangender or intersex people in the world, but most have concluded that the widespread use of right-handed scissors simply makes the most sense since left handed people are outnumbered by right handed people at a ratio of approximately 9 to 1 -- it's not discriminatory, just common sense based on population statistics. In like manner, to get the most people covered with the least bathrooms (and hence least associated costs to build and maintain bathrooms), it just makes sense to have male and female bathrooms.

As to which individuals use which bathrooms, I personally don't have much a preference. Whatever makes them (you) feel comfortable. I would point out, however, that women are disproportionally represented in sexual violence statistics, so that if there were to be any sort of restriction on who could use what bathroom, it would make the most sense to limit access to female bathrooms.

### Affirmative Action

I am not in favor of the current policies being pursued, namely, those that admit less prepared students simply because of their skin color. It is unquestionably true that poverty is cyclical, and that many African Americans were driven into or kept in poverty by discrimination. However, history is replete with examples of historically oppressed groups overcoming their disadvantaged status without external aid. Jews, for example, have traditionally faced persecution from many groups, but have flourished nevertheless. Post war Germany also comes to mind. If it were impossible to climb out of disadvantageous circumstances, every group conquered throughout all of history (and thereby deprived of education, wealth, and even ownership of their own bodies depending on the circumstances) would have never recovered.

Furthermore, the approach of fighting inequality with more inequality is questionable: what happens if a better prepared poor white student is kept out of college because the spot was given to a less prepared wealthy black student? You just discriminated against a white student stricty on the basis of his skin color. Thirty years from now when his children are unable to compete due to growing up in a life of hardship, who is at fault?

I am an advocate for a strict meritocracy that understands that diversity is simply one piece of the puzzle (i.e., a strict meritocracy that rightly views merit as an aggregation of many factors, including diversity, rather than as a set of test scores). A non-standard viewpoint *is* valuable, and it is perfectly fine for it to be one of the criteria used to judge a student's merit. However, such determinations need to be made with an even hand across racial groups -- to the extent that minorities' viewpoints *actually are* non-standard (and hence diverse), to that extent they should be valued, but no more or less. This should equally hold true in the case of asians: they should benefit from their diverse point of view (as compared with the white majority's) just as much as blacks or hispanics should benefit from theirs. I would argue that race is poorer proxy for diversity than cultural self-identification and socioeconomic status in any case.

Finally, the idea of continuing "compensations" to right past wrongs is problematic in a general sense. For example, should Italians be forced to pay Germans reparations for all the centuries that the Romans oppressed the German tribes 2,000 years ago? Should Turks be forced to pay Greeks reparations for the sack of Byzantium and subsequent dismantling of Greek society (which has arguably contributed to Greece's present poor economy)? There are some omelettes that can't be unscrambled -- the solution is not channeling anger from the past, but hope for the future.
