## Please Note: This Page Is In Progress

This means, among other things, that:

- Some of the content is not fleshed out, so you should not read more into things than exactly what is there.
- Some sections might have things marked as "TODOs" (e.g., questions or things that must be done). These TODOs should not be taken to be representative of truth in any respect, and indicate areas that need more research and thought. If you have particular knowledge in things related to these, you can help! (Please see: [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/StevenTammen/steventammen.github.io#contribution-guidelines)).
- There probably will not be any section that pulls everything together in an easily understandable way.

This does not mean that:

- I am not firmly convinced of the veracity of all the content currently published. If I am not sure of something, I don't push it to the website. (This doesn't mean that I won't ever change my positions if I come to learn that I am in error, but that I strive, as much as possible, to only push content to the website if I am absolutely certain that it is true).
- This page cannot be helpful to you in its present form. If you are aware of the limitations of the current state, you may find this page helpful long before I officially publish it.

## Frequency
- Disambiguation of homophones/briefing most common usage
- Creation of coda sounds (/th/, /nk/, /mp/, etc.) second most common usage
- Capitalization least common usage

## Layout On Stenotype
- Left pinky extension keys worst location
   - ⇒ capitalization goes here
   - For things without capitalization, used for additional disambiguators
   - In other words, if there is any capitalization, it will go on left pinky for consistency, otherwise, those keys are freed up to use for alternate forms/briefs
- Right index column second best location
   - Coda pinky extension keys (-D, -Z) more common than capitalization/additional disambiguation ⇒ finger contortion minimized by having more index extension on side with less pinky extension (i.e., not on this side)
   - ⇒ Creation of coda sounds goes here
      - Also, makes logical/intuitive sense to have modifier keys on the same side as the coda keys to make modified coda sounds (with the exception of S*, but whatever)
- Left index column best location
   - ⇒ Disambiguation/briefing goes here

## Top key on coda side
- Can be used as third disambiguator key all the time except when -F is stroked as part of the coda, at which point + acts as a coda sound creator (i.e., acts as if it were \*)
- In other words, -+F____ will create coda sounds, -+____ will act as disambiguator

## Basic Usage
- Disambiguation/briefing priority: prioritize left index bottom > left index top > right index top > left pinky bot > left pinky top.
  Hand ergonomics: bottom index/pinky better than top index/pinky (flexion > contraction for these fingers), even if adjacent middle/ring finger on top. Test for yourself.
   - Always consistent order for what keys gets used, no more ambiguity. Can use additional disambiguation keys to create identical forms if they are not needed to disambiguate ("mis-strokes", if you will).
- Symbol legibility, in my opinion, goes in the order of ^ > \* > ~ > + > = > \# > other things like @%$& etc. Can change if you disagree.

## Example

The following words present a good test case: mat, Matt, matte, math, meat, meet, mete, Meath (the county in Ireland), and meeth (an archaic name for mead)

## Accounting For Finger Use

If finger(s) are needed for keys in their column(s), there are still ways to disambiguate:

Left Index Top (H)

- Chord With ~
- +
- =
- \#

Left Index Bot (R)

- Chord With ^
- +
- =
- \#

Right Index Top (-F)

- \^
- ~
- =
- \#

Right Index Bot (-R)

- \^
- ~
- =
- \#

Left Index Top (H) and Right Index Top (-F)

- Chord with ~
- =
- \#

Left Index Bot (R) and Right Index Top (-F)

- Chord with ^
- =
- \#

Left Index Top (H) and Right Index Bot (-R)

- Chord with ~
- =
- \#



Left Index Bot (R) and Right Index Bot (-R)

- Chord with ^
- =
- \#

Left Index Top (H), Right Index Top (-F), Left Pinky Top (S)

- Chord With ~
- Chord With \#

Etc.

- Have strokes for intermediate operators and characters: \+, \-, \*, \/, :, en-dash. Stroke introduces character and re-enters num mode.
- Have strokes that add two zeroes (hundreds), three zeroes (thousands), etc. Also have stroke that adds commas to the previous number (e.g., 5450.30 --> 5,450.30).

- Rough guide. Switch around order of commands based on frequency.

## TODO

- Keyboard steno machine combined — best of both worlds or interference with both worlds?
- Switching on same physical machine between discrete and chorded entry types depending on task — no need for fingerspelling if you have a full keyboard that you can go faster on. Figure out way to switch in and out efficiently.
- Keyboard-like vim command mode for steno (less overall hand movement, excepting multistage commands like spacemacs commands?), or stroked out (more movement but easier to remember… but to make all commands single stroke still requires some memorization?).
