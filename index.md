## Worthy Projects

This is a list of physical products and software programs that I think should exist but currently do not. I am unsure how many I will be able to make progress on given my busy schedule. I would prefer to keep everything open source (including designs for physical products), but if somebody wants to take any of these to market, I would be happy to explain in excruciating detail how I would design each thing free of charge. In other words, I would rather that they exist in a proprietary form than in no form at all, even though I would prefer that they exist in an open source form.

If you think you can help in any way or are just curious about my thoughts, please email me at [steven@steventammen.com](mailto:steven@steventammen.com).

### Physical Products

- Development of an open source, split-hand, concacave, columnar, portable, 40-key ergonomic keyboard -- one that takes design cues from the [Dactyl Keyboard](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) while slimming down the number of keys to only those directly touching finger home positions.
- Development of an open source, ergonomic, finger-controlled trackball that allows for a perfectly straight wrist and low pronation.
- Development of an open source, side-actuated mechanical pencil: an update of the now-discontinued [Pentel Original Quicker Clicker](http://www.pentel.com/store/quicker-clicker-mechanical-pencil-original-config).
- Development of an open source, fully waterproof multi-purpose backpack: an update of the now-discontinued [Ortlieb Flight 27](http://www.wiggle.fr/sac-a-dos-ortlieb-flight-27-litres-avec-tizip/).

### Software Programs

- Development of an open source, cross-platform software program that supports remapping, hotstrings, layers, macros, running programs through a hotstring/macro, opening URLs in the default browser through a hotstring/macro, and so forth. Also develop a spin-off project for implementing as meany features as possible on the firmware level. (Perhaps starting with [TMK firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) as a base?)
- Development of an open source, cross-platform program to enable Vim/Spacemacs emulation across the entire operating system environment (configurable by .vimrc/.spacemacs files just like Vim/Spacemacs). Focus on making uneditable text selectable, links/menus accessible by keyboard, and commands consistent across programs.
- Development of an open source universal electronic publishing standard (for novels, reference books, articles, etc.)
- Development of an open source, cross-platform e-reading program, to be used (non-exclusively) with the standard above. Also develop API for using the optimally designed reading interface in web pages.
