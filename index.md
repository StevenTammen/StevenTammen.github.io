## Worthy Projects ([email me](mailto:steven@steventammen.com) if interested)

- Development of an open-source, cross-platform keyboard program that supports remapping, hotstrings, layers, macros, operating system interfacing (e.g., running programs through a key sequence, opening URLs in the default browser through a key sequence), and so forth.
- Development of an open-source, cross-platform program to enable Vim emulation across the entire operating system environment (configurable by .vimrc files just like Vim itself).
- Development of an open-source universal electronic publishing standard (for novels, reference books, articles, etc.)
- Devlopment of an open-source, cross-platform e-reading program, to be used (non-exclusively) with the standard above. Develop API for using the optimally designed reading interface in web pages.
- Development of a side-actuated mechanical pencil: an update of the now-discontinued Pentel Original Quicker Clicker.
- Development of a fully waterproof multi-purpose backpack: an update of the now-discontinued Ortlieb Flight 27.
