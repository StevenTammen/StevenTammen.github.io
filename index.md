## Worthy Projects

This is a list of physical products and software programs that I think should exist but currently do not. I am unsure how many I will be able to make progress on given my busy schedule. I would prefer to keep everything open source (including designs for physical products), but if somebody wants to take any of these to market, I would be happy to explain in excruciating detail how I would design each thing free of charge. In other words, I would rather that they exist in a proprietary form than in no form at all, even though I would prefer that they exist in an open source form.

If you think you can help in any way or are just curious about my thoughts, please email me at [steven@steventammen.com](mailto:steven@steventammen.com). I plan to write more fully on each of these ideas when I get the time. (I'll link to these more full explanations as they are available).

### Physical Products

- Development of an open source, split-hand, concacave, columnar, portable, 40-key ergonomic keyboard -- one that takes design cues from the [Dactyl Keyboard](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) while slimming down the number of keys to only those directly touching finger home positions.
- Development of an open source, ergonomic, finger-controlled trackball that allows for a perfectly straight wrist and low pronation.
- Development of an open source, portable, adjustable writing desk/laptop stand/book stand. Start with designs like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Laptop-Table-Stand-Adjustable-Ergonomic-Mount-Ultrabook-Macbook-Aluminum-Black/dp/B00EP48NMY/), add a better designed mouse pad (that can be attached to the adjustable legs or the surface), arms to hold papers/books in place when working/reading, a connection mechanism to backpack straps to make it double as a portable standing desk, etc.
- Development of an open source, side-actuated mechanical pencil: an update of the now-discontinued [Pentel Original Quicker Clicker](http://www.pentel.com/store/quicker-clicker-mechanical-pencil-original-config).
- Development of an open source, fully waterproof multi-purpose backpack: an update of the now-discontinued [Ortlieb Flight 27](http://www.wiggle.fr/sac-a-dos-ortlieb-flight-27-litres-avec-tizip/).

### Software Programs

- Development of an open source, cross-platform software program that supports remapping, hotstrings, layers, macros, running programs through a hotstring/macro, opening URLs in the default browser through a hotstring/macro, and so forth. Also develop a spin-off project for implementing as meany features as possible on the firmware level. (Perhaps contributing to [QMK firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard)?)
- Development of an open source, cross-platform program to enable Vim/Spacemacs emulation across the entire operating system environment (configurable by .vimrc/.spacemacs files just like Vim/Spacemacs). Focus on making uneditable text selectable, links/menus accessible by keyboard, and commands consistent across programs.
- Development of an open source universal electronic publishing standard (for novels, reference books, articles, etc.)
- Development of an open source, cross-platform e-reading program, to be used (non-exclusively) with the standard above. Also develop API for using the optimally designed reading interface in web pages.
- Development of an open source, narrowly scoped, networking platform to connect people with others who match them quantitavely across attributes. Think Facebook and Tinder except with way more emphasis about harnessing the amazing data-crunching abilities of computers to connect people who align on attributes. Allow user-defined rankings of attribute importance, and also allow for privitazation of attributes (obviously keep data secure). Try to stay out of strict use cases (e.g., funneling users into using the platform as a dating app, a business networking app, etc.) and focus on designing an intelligent algorithm to give people an option for having a quantitative base for forming relationships with others -- to take the guesswork out of finding people *like* you (for hobby groups, discussion groups, potential partners, etc.) and people *unlike* you (for getting perspective, having intelligent debates, etc.). Try to enforce a standard of honesty to make results meaningful.
- Development of an open source, crowd-driven charity app. Focus on completely eliminating overhead and organizing local groups of volunteers to effectively get stuff done. Have options for users to self-identify in fields related to their talents. For example, a person in building construction can declare so and get matched with people with complementary skills or necessary material assistance -- like a person with organization/leadership skills, a person with supply chain/procurement skills, and a person who has access to a cement-mixer and bulldozer from their day-job connections -- to help lay the foundation for a new charity hospital. Also figure out some way to sort and analyze the validity and urgency of requests for assistance to most effectively prioritize aid.
- Development of an open source translation platform for international scholarship, allowing multilingul academics to widen access to research that would otherwise be language-restricted. Work to enable a feedback and correction system for the translations, and perhaps even get into natural language processing and AI/machine learning to automate some of the translation.
- Development of an open source peer review scholarship platform to free scholarship from paywalls, journal exclusivity, and ideas of "publish once and don't update." Much more emphasis on continuous improvement than static content in journals. Try to focus on objective criteria (e.g., problems in research methodology, ideas for replicability and generalizability) over subjective opinions of work. Try to get it accepted by influential academics across many fields to get research in an environment more conducive to actual rapid knowledge advancement: dynamic, open source content vs. static paywall-protected scholarship.
  - Also try to generalize it to internet content in general. The internet has a vast amount of knowledge, but not all of it is correct/verifiable, and some of it is downright misleading. Creating an environment to filter the junk from the interesting, useful information would be *huge* in increasing the overall usefulness of internet research across fields.
